<span class="small">TO</span><br />

A DIALOGUE CONCERNING WOMEN.</h2>


<p>The author of this Dialogue, as Dr Johnson has observed, was
more remarkable for his familiarity with men of genius, than for
any productions of his own. He was the son of Joseph Walsh of
Abberley, in Worcestershire, and was born to an easy fortune.
This last circumstance may have contributed something to the extreme
respect in which he seems to have been held by the most
accomplished of his age. Dryden, in the Postscript to “Virgil,”
calls Walsh the best critic of the English nation; and, in the following
Preface, he is profuse in his commendation. But though these
praises may have exceeded the measure of Walsh’s desert, posterity
owe a grateful remembrance to him, who, though a staunch
Whig, respected and befriended Dryden in age and adversity, and
who encouraged the juvenile essays of Pope, by foretelling his future
eminence. Walsh’s own Poems and Essays entitle him to respectable
rank among the minor poets. His Essay on the Pastorals
of Virgil, which he contributed to our author’s version, may
be found Vol. XIII. p. 345.</p>

<p>The “Dialogue concerning Women,” contains a critical disquisition
upon the virtues and foibles of the sex. But though the
pleasantry be stale, and the learning pedantic, it seems to have excited
some attention when published; perhaps because, as an angry
Defender of the ladies observes,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;“To begin with Dryden’s dreadful name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should mark out something of no common fame.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I cannot omit remarking, that the Dialogue concludes with a
profuse panegyric, upon a theme not very congenial to Dryden’s
political feelings, the character of Queen Mary.

<h2>PREFACE<br />

<span class="small">TO</span><br />

WALSH’S DIALOGUE<br />

<span class="medium">CONCERNING WOMEN.</span></h2>


<p>The perusal of this Dialogue, in defence of the
fair sex, written by a gentleman of my acquaintance,
much surprised me; for it was not easy for
me to imagine, that one so young[1] could have
treated so nice a subject with so much judgment.
It is true, I was not ignorant, that he was naturally
ingenious, and that he had improved himself by
travelling; and from thence I might reasonably
have expected that air of gallantry, which is so visibly
diffused through the body of the work, and is
indeed the soul that animates all things of this nature;
but so much variety of reading, both in ancient
and modern authors, such digestion of that
reading, so much justness of thought, that it leaves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
no room for affectation, or pedantry, I may venture
to say, are not over-common amongst practised
writers, and very rarely to be found amongst beginners.
It puts me in mind of what was said of
Mr Waller, the father of our English numbers, upon
the sight of his first verses, by the wits of the last
age; that he came out into the world forty thousand
strong, before they heard of him.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Here, in
imitation of my friend’s apostrophes, I hope the
reader need not be told, that Mr Waller is only
mentioned for honour’s sake; that I am desirous of
laying hold on his memory, on all occasions, and
thereby acknowledging to the world, that unless he
had written, none of us could write.</p>

<p>I know, my friend will forgive me this digression;
for it is not only a copy of his style, but of
his candour. The reader will observe, that he is
ready for all hints of commending merit, and the
writers of this age and country are particularly
obliged to him, for his pointing out those passages
which the French call <i>beaux endroits</i>, wherein they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
have most excelled. And though I may seem in
this to have my own interest in my eyes, because
he has more than once mentioned me<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> so much to
my advantage, yet I hope the reader will take it
only for a parenthesis, because the piece would
have been very perfect without it. I may be suffered
to please myself with the kindness of my
friend, without valuing myself upon his partiality;
he had not confidence enough to send it out into
the world, without my opinion of it, that it might
pass securely, at least amongst the fair readers, for
whose service it was principally designed. I am
not so presuming to think my opinion can either be
his touchstone, or his passport; but I thought I
might send him back to Ariosto, who has made it
the business of almost thirty stanzas, in the beginning
of the thirty-seventh book of his “Orlando
Furioso,” not only to praise that beautiful part of
the creation, but also to make a sharp satire on
their enemies; to give mankind their own, and to
tell them plainly, that from their envy it proceeds,
that the virtue and great actions of women are purposely
concealed, and the failings of some few
amongst them exposed with all the aggravating
circumstances of malice. For my own part, who
have always been their servant, and have never
drawn my pen against them, I had rather see some
of them praised extraordinarily, than any of them
suffer by detraction; and that in this age, and at
this time particularly, wherein I find more heroines
than heroes. Let me therefore give them joy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
their new champion. If any will think me more
partial to him than really I am, they can only say,
I have returned his bribe; and the worst I wish him
is, that he may receive justice from the men, and
favour only from the ladies.

<h2>CHARACTER OF M. ST. EVREMONT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles de St Denis</span>, Seigneur de St Evremont, was born
in 1613, of a noble Norman family, and was early distinguished
by the vivacity of his wit, as well as by his gallantry; for,
like all the French noblesse, he followed the profession of arms.
The Duke D’Enghien, afterwards Prince of Conde, was particularly
attached to him, and gave him an appointment in his household.
This he lost by ill-timed raillery on his patron. He was
committed to the Bastile for a joke on cardinal Mazarine; and afterwards
forced to fly into Holland for writing a satirical history
of the peace of the Pyrenees. From Holland St Evremont retreated
to England, where, at the witty court of Charles, his raillery
was better understood than in Holland, and less likely to incur
unpleasant consequences than in France. St Evremont naturally
addressed himself to his fair countrywomen Louise de Querouaille
Duchess of Portsmouth, and the Duchess of Mazarine; and,
though they were rivals in Charles’s affections, they united in protecting
the Norman <i>bel-esprit</i>. The king conferred on him a thousand
caresses, and a small pension; on which he lived, amusing
himself by the composition of lighter pieces of literature, and despising
the country which afforded him refuge so very thoroughly,
that he did not even deign to learn English. The people of England
did not, however, consider the labours of their foreign guest
with similar apathy. After several surreptitious editions of his various
tracts had appeared, there was published, in 1692, a collection
entitled, “Miscellaneous Essays, by Monsieur St Evremont,
translated out of French; with his character, by a person of
honour here in England, continued by Mr Dryden.” Desmaiseaux,
by whom a complete edition of St Evremont’s works was
edited in 1705, mentions it as well known, that Dr Knightly
Chetwood, who died dean of Gloucester, was the person of honour
in the title-page of 1692. His connection with Dryden makes
this highly probable; although there is reason to believe, that
the title of “person of honour” was not strictly applicable, and
was probably assumed for the purpose of disguising the real translator.

<h2>CHARACTER<br />
<span class="small">OF</span><br />
M. ST. EVREMONT.</h2>


<p>I know how nice an undertaking it is to write of
a living author; yet the example of Father Bouhours
has somewhat encouraged me in this attempt.
Had not Monsieur St Evremont been very considerable
in his own country, that famous jesuit would
not have ventured to praise a person in disgrace
with the government of France, and living here in
banishment. Yet, in his “<i>Pensees Ingenieuses</i>,” he
has often cited our author’s thoughts and his expressions,
as the standard of judicious thinking, and
graceful speaking; an undoubted sign that his merit
was sufficiently established, when the disfavour
of the court could not prevail against it. There is
not only a justness in his conceptions, which is the
foundation of good writing, but also a purity of
language, and a beautiful turn of words, so little
understood by modern writers; and which, indeed,
was found at Rome but at the latter end of the
commonwealth, and ended with Petronius, under
the monarchy. If I durst extend my judgment to
particulars, I would say, that our author has determined
very nicely in his opinion of Epicurus; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
that what he has said of his morals, is according to
nature and reason.</p>

<p>It is true, that as I am a religious admirer of Virgil,
I could wish that he had not discovered our father’s
nakedness.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> But, after all, we must confess,
that &AElig;neas was none of the greatest heroes, and
that Virgil was sensible of it himself. But what
could he do? the Trojan on whom he was to build
the Roman empire, had been already vanquished;
he had lost his country, and was a fugitive. Nay
more, he had fought unsuccessfully with Diomedes,
and was only preserved from death by his mother-goddess,
who received a wound in his defence. So
that Virgil, bound as he was to follow the footsteps
of Homer, who had thus described him, could not
reasonably have altered his character, and raised
him in Italy to a much greater height of prowess
than he found him formerly in Troy. Since, therefore,
he could make no more of him in valour, he
resolved not to give him that virtue, as his principal;
but chose another, which was piety. It is
true, this latter, in the composition of a hero, was
not altogether so shining as the former; but it entitled
him more to the favour of the gods, and their
protection, in all his undertakings; and, which was
the poet’s chiefest aim, made a nearer resemblance
betwixt &AElig;neas and his patron Augustus C&aelig;sar,
who, above all things, loved to be flattered for being
pious, both to the gods and his relations. And
that very piety, or gratitude, (call it which you
please,) to the memory of his uncle Julius, gave him
the preference, amongst the soldiers, to Mark Antony;
and, consequently, raised him to the empire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
As for personal courage, that of Augustus was not
pushing;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and the poet, who was not ignorant of
that defect, for that reason durst not ascribe it, in
the supreme degree, to him who was to represent
his emperor under another name: which was managed
by him with the most imaginable fineness;
for had valour been set uppermost, Augustus must
have yielded to Agrippa. After all, this is rather to
defend the courtier than the poet; and to make
his hero escape again, under the covert of a cloud.
Only we may add, what I think Bossu says, that
the Roman commonwealth being now changed into
a monarchy, Virgil was helping to that design;
by insinuating into the people the piety of their
new conqueror, to make them the better brook this
innovation, which was brought on them by a man
who was favoured by the gods. Yet we may observe,
that Virgil forgot not, upon occasion, to
speak honourably of &AElig;neas, in point of courage,
and that particularly in the person of him by whom
he was overcome. For Diomedes compares him
with Hector, and even with advantage:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quicquid apud dur&aelig; cessatum est m&aelig;nia Troj&aelig;,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>H&aelig;sit, et in decimum vestigia retulit annum:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ambo animis, ambo insignes pr&aelig;stantibus armis;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hic pietate prior.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As for that particular passage, cited by Monsieur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
St Evremont, where &AElig;neas shows the utmost fear,
in the beginning of a tempest,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Extemplo &AElig;ne&aelig; solvuntur frigore membra</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>why may it not be supposed, that having been long
at sea, he might be well acquainted with the nature
of a storm; and, by the rough beginning, foresee
the increase and danger of it? at least, as a father
of his people, his concernment might be greater for
them than for himself: and if so, what the poet
takes from the merit of his courage, is added to the
prime virtue of his character, which was his piety.
Be this said with all manner of respect and deference
to the opinion of Monsieur St Evremont;
amongst whose admirable talents, that of penetration
is not the least. He generally dives into the
very bottom of his authors; searches into the inmost
recesses of their souls, and brings up with him
those hidden treasures which had escaped the diligence
of others. His examination of the “<i>Grand
Alexandre,</i>”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> in my opinion, is an admirable piece
of criticism; and I doubt not, but that his observations
on the English theatre had been as absolute
in their kind, had he seen with his own eyes, and
not with those of other men. But conversing in a
manner wholly with the court, which is not always
the truest judge, he has been unavoidably led into
mistakes, and given to some of our coarsest poets a
reputation abroad, which they never had at home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Had his conversation in the town been more general,
he had certainly received other ideas on that
subject; and not transmitted those names into his
own country, which will be forgotten by posterity
in ours.</p>

<p>Thus I have contracted my thoughts on a large
subject; for whatever has been said falls short of
the true character of Monsieur St Evremont, and
his writings: and if the translation you are about
to read does not every where come up to the original,
the translator desires you to believe, that it is
only because that he has failed in his undertaking.

<h2>CHARACTER OF POLYBIUS.</h2>


<p>The character of Polybius was prefixed to a translation executed
by Sir Henry Shere, or Sheers;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the same gentleman
whom Dryden has elsewhere classed among the “finer spirits
of the age.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Our author had announced this work to the public
in the preface to “Cleomenes.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It was probably at that time
under the press, or at least subjected to Dryden for his correction.
The translation itself is of little value. Sir Henry disclaims
all extent of erudition, and frankly confesses, he “has no
warrant from his depth of learning whereof to make ostentation;
wherein, indeed, he who most abounds ever finds least cause of
boasting.” Accordingly, his preface is employed in an attempt
to convince the world, that mere scholars, or book-learned men,
have rather traduced than translated Polybius, and most authors
of his class; such being totally at a loss to discover the sense of
many passages in history, wherein matters military and naval are
handled. He therefore takes up the pen as a man of the world,
of business, science, and conversation, long intimate with such
matters as are principally treated of by the historian. Finally,
he describes his undertaking as an “employment, wherein he
who performs best, traffics for small gain, and it would be unfair
and unconscionable to make the loss more than the adventure;
and, at the worst, it having been rather a diversion than a task,
helping me to while away a few winter hours, which is some recreation
to one who has led a life of action and business; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
whose humour and fortune suit not with the pleasures of the
town. Wherefore I shall have little cause of complaint, if my
well-meaning in consenting to its publication be not so well received:
I have been worse treated by the world, to which I am as
little indebted as most men, who have spent near thirty years in
public trusts; wherein I laboured, and wasted my youth and the
vigour of my days, more to the service of my country, and the
impairment of my health, than the improvement of my fortune;
having stood the mark of envy, slander, and hard usage, without
gleaning the least of those advantages, which use to be the anchor-hold
and refuge of such as wrongfully or otherwise suffer the stroke
of censure.”</p>

<p>Our author, who seems to have had an especial regard for Sir
Henry Shere, contributed this preliminary discourse.</p>

<p>Mr Malone has fixed Sir Henry Shere’s death to the year 1713,
when his library was exposed to sale by advertisement in “The
Guardian.”

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
CHARACTER OF POLYBIUS,<br />
<span class="small">AND</span><br />
<span class="large">HIS WRITINGS.</span><br /></h2>


<p>The worthy author of this translation, who is very
much my friend, was pleased to entrust it in my
hands for many months together, before he published
it, desiring me to review the English, and
to correct what I found amiss; which he needed
not have done, if his modesty would have given
him leave to have relied on his own abilities, who
is so great a master of our style and language, as
the world will acknowledge him to be, after the
reading of this excellent version.</p>

<p>It is true, that Polybius has formerly appeared in
an English dress,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> but under such a cloud of errors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
in his first translation, that his native beauty was
not only hidden, but his sense perverted in many
places; so that he appeared unlike himself, and
unworthy of that esteem which has always been
paid him by antiquity, as the most sincere, the
clearest, and most instructive of all historians. He
is now not only redeemed from those mistakes, but
also restored to the first purity of his conceptions;
and the style in which he now speaks is as plain and
unaffected as that he wrote. I had only the pleasure
of reading him in a fair manuscript, without the
toil of alteration; at least it was so very inconsiderable,
that it only cost me the dash of a pen in
some few places, and those of very small importance.
So much had the care, the diligence, and
exactness of my friend prevented my trouble, that
he left me not the occasion of serving him, in a
work which was already finished to my hands. I
doubt not but the reader will approve my judgement.
So happy it is for a good author to fall
into the hands of a translator, who is of a genius
like his own; who has added experience to his
natural abilities; who has been educated in business
of several kinds; has travelled, like his author,
into many parts of the world, and some of
them the same with the present scene of history;
has been employed in business of the like nature
with Polybius, and, like him, is perfectly acquainted
not only with the terms of the mathematics, but
has searched into the bottom of that admirable
science, and reduced into practice the most useful
rules of it, to his own honour, and the benefit of
his native country; who, besides these advantages,
possesses the knowledge of shipping and navigation;
and, in few words, is not ignorant of any
thing that concerns the tactics: so that here, from
the beginning, we are sure of finding nothing that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
is not thoroughly understood.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The expression is
clear, and the words adequate to the subject. Nothing
in the matter will be mistaken; nothing of
the terms will be misapplied: all is natural and
proper; and he who understands good sense and
English, will be profited by the first, and delighted
with the latter. This is what may be justly said in
commendation of the translator, and without the
note of flattery to a friend.</p>

<p>As for his author, I shall not be ashamed to copy
from the learned Casaubon, who has translated him
into Latin,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> many things which I had not from my
own small reading, and which I could not, without
great difficulty, have drawn, but from his fountain;
not omitting some which came casually in my way,
by reading the preface of the Abbot Pichon to the
Dauphin’s “Tacitus,” an admirable and most useful
work; which helps I ingenuously profess to have
received from them, both to clear myself from being
a plagiary of their writings, and to give authority,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
by their names, to the weakness of my own
performance.</p>

<p>The taking of Constantinople, by Mahomet the
Great, fell into the latter times of Pope Nicholas
the Fifth,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> a pope not only studious of good letters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
and particularly of history, but also a great encourager
of it in others. From the dreadful overthrow
of that city, and final subversion of the Greek empire,
many learned men escaped, and brought over
with them into Italy that treasure of ancient authors,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
which, by their unhappiness, we now possess;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and, amongst the rest, some of these remaining
fragments of Polybius. The body of this history,
as he left it finished, was consisting of forty
books, of which the eighth part<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> is only remaining
to us entire. As for his negociations, when he was
sent ambassador either from his own countrymen,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
the commonwealth of the Achaians, or afterwards
was employed by the Romans on their business
with other nations, we are obliged to Constantine
the Great for their preservation; for that emperor
was so much in love with the dexterous management
and wisdom of our author, that he caused
them all to be faithfully transcribed, and made frequent
use of them in his own dispatches and affairs
with foreign princes, as his best guides in his concernments
with them.</p>

<p>Polybius, as you will find in reading of him,
though he principally intended the history of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Romans, and the establishment of their empire over
the greatest part of the world which was then
known, yet had in his eye the general history of
the times in which he lived, not forgetting either
the wars of his own country with their neighbours
of Etolia, or the concurrent affairs of Macedonia
and the provinces of Greece, which is properly so
called; nor the monarchies of Asia and Egypt; nor
the republic of the Carthaginians, with the several
traverses of their fortunes, either in relation to the
Romans, or independent to the wars which they
waged with them; besides what happened in Spain
and Sicily, and other European countries. The
time, which is taken up in this history, consists of
three-and-fifty years; and the greatest part of it is
employed in the description of those events, of
which the author was an eye-witness, or bore a
considerable part in the conduct of them. But in
what particular time or age it was, when mankind
received that irrecoverable loss of this noble history,
is not certainly delivered to us. It appears to
have been perfect in the reign of Constantine, by
what I have already noted; and neither Casaubon,
nor any other, can give us any further account concerning
it.</p>

<p>The first attempt towards a translation of him,
was by command of the same Pope Nicholas the
Fifth, already mentioned, who esteemed him the
prince of Greek historians; would have him continually
in his hands; and used to make this judgement
of him,&mdash;that, if he yielded to one or two, in
the praise of eloquence, yet, in wisdom, and all
other accomplishments belonging to a perfect historian,
he was at least equal to any other writer,
Greek or Roman, and perhaps excelled them all.
This is the author, who is now offered to us in our
mother-tongue, recommended by the nobility of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
his birth, by his institution in arts and sciences,
by his knowledge in natural and moral philosophy,
and particularly the politics; by his being conversant
both in the arts of peace and war; by his education
under his father Lycortas, who voluntarily
deposed himself from his sovereignty of Megalopolis
to become a principal member of the Achaian
commonwealth, which then flourished under the
management of Aratus; by his friendship with
Scipio Africanus, who subdued Carthage, to whom
he was both a companion and a counsellor; and by
the good-will, esteem, and intimacy, which he had
with several princes of Asia, Greece, and Egypt,
during his life; and after his decease, by deserving
the applause and approbation of all succeeding
ages.</p>

<p>This author, so long neglected in the barbarous
times of Christianity, and so little known in Europe,
(according to the fate which commonly follows
the best of writers,) was pulled from under the
rubbish which covered him, by the learned bishop,
Nicholas the Fifth; and some parts of his history
(for with all his diligence he was not able to recover
the whole) were by him recommended to a
person knowing both in the Greek and Roman
tongues, and learned for the times in which he
lived, to be translated into Latin; and, to the honour
of our Polybius, he was amongst the first of
the Greek writers, who deserved to have this care
bestowed on him; which, notwithstanding so many
hindrances occurred in this attempt, that the work
was not perfected in his popedom, neither was any
more than a third part of what is now recovered
in his hands; neither did that learned Italian,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
had undertaken him, succeed very happily in that
endeavour; for the perfect knowledge of the Greek
language was not yet restored, and that translator
was but as a one-eyed man amongst the nation
of the blind; only suffered till a better could be
found to do right to an author, whose excellence
required a more just interpreter than the ignorance
of that age afforded. And this gives me occasion
to admire, (says Casaubon,) that in following
times, when eloquence was redeemed, and the
knowledge of the Greek language flourished, yet
no man thought of pursuing that design, which
was so worthily begun in those first rudiments of
learning. Some, indeed, of almost every nation in
Europe, have been instrumental in the recovery of
several lost parts of our Polybius, and commented
on them with good success; but no man before
Casaubon had reviewed the first translation, corrected
its errors, and put the last hand to its accomplishment.
The world is therefore beholden
to him for this great work; for he has collected into
one their scattered fragments, has pieced them together,
according to the natural order in which
they were written, made them intelligible to scholars,
and rendered the French translator’s task more
easy to his hands.</p>

<p>Our author is particularly mentioned with great
honour by Cicero, Strabo, Josephus, and Plutarch;
and in what rank of writers they are placed, none
of the learned need to be informed. He is copied
in whole books together, by Livy, commonly
esteemed the prince of the Roman history, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
translated word for word, though the Latin historian
is not to be excused, for not mentioning the
man to whom he had been so much obliged, nor for
taking, as his own, the worthy labours of another.
Marcus Brutus, who preferred the freedom of his
country to the obligations which he had to Julius
C&aelig;sar, so prized Polybius, that he made a compendium
of his works; and read him not only for his
instruction, but for the diversion of his grief, when
his noble enterprize for the restoration of the commonwealth
had not found the success which it deserved.
And this is not the least commendation of
our author, that he, who was not wholly satisfied
with the eloquence of Tully, should epitomise
Polybius with his own hand.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> It was on the consideration
of Brutus, and the veneration which he
paid him, that Constantine the Great took so great
a pleasure in reading our author, and collecting the
several treaties of his embassies; of which, though
many are now lost, yet those which remain are a
sufficient testimony of his abilities; and I congratulate
my country, that a prince of our extraction
(as was Constantine,) has the honour of obliging
the Christian world by these remainders of our great
historian.</p>

<p>It is now time to enter into the particular praises
of Polybius, which I have given you before in gross;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and the first of them (following the method of Casaubon,)
is his wonderful skill in political affairs. I
had read him, in English, with the pleasure of a
boy, before I was ten years of age; and yet, even
then, had some dark notions of the prudence with
which he conducted his design, particularly in making
me know, and almost see, the places where
such and such actions were performed. This was
the first distinction which I was then capable of
making betwixt him and other historians which I
read early. But when being of a riper age, I took
him again into my hands, I must needs say, that I
have profited more by reading him than by Thucydides,
Appian, Dion Cassius, and all the rest of the
Greek historians together; and amongst all the Romans,
none have reached him, in this particular, but
Tacitus, who is equal with him.</p>

<p>It is wonderful to consider with how much care
and application he instructs, counsels, warns, admonishes,
and advises, whensoever he can find a
fit occasion. He performs all these sometimes in
the nature of a common parent of mankind; and
sometimes also limits his instructions to particular
nations, by a friendly reproach of those failings
and errors to which they were most obnoxious.
In this last manner he gives instructions to the
Mantin&aelig;ans, the El&aelig;ans, and several other provinces
of Greece, by informing them of such things
as were conducing to their welfare. Thus he likewise
warns the Romans of their obstinacy and wilfulness,
vices which have often brought them to
the brink of ruin. And thus he frequently exhorts
the Greeks, in general, not to depart from their
dependence on the Romans; nor to take false measures,
by embroiling themselves in wars with that
victorious people, in whose fate it was to be masters
of the universe. But as his peculiar concernment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
was for the safety of his own countrymen,
the Achaians, he more than once insinuates to
them the care of their preservation, which consisted
in submitting to the yoke of the Roman people,
which they could not possibly avoid; and to make
it easy to them, by a cheerful compliance with
their commands, rather than unprofitably to oppose
them with the hazard of those remaining privileges
which the clemency of the conquerors had
left them. For this reason, in the whole course of
his history he makes it his chiefest business to persuade
the Grecians in general, that the growing
greatness and fortune of the Roman empire was
not owing to mere chance, but to the conduct and
invincible courage of that people, to whom their
own virtue gave the dominion of the world. And
yet this counsellor of patience and submission, as
long as there was any probability of hope remaining
to withstand the progress of the Roman fortune,
was not wanting to the utmost of his power
to resist them, at least to defer the bondage of his
country, which he had long foreseen. But the fates
inevitably drawing all things into subjection to
Rome, this well-deserving citizen was commanded
to appear in that city,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> where he suffered the imprisonment
of many years; yet even then his virtue
was beneficial to him, the knowledge of his
learning and his wisdom procuring him the friendship
of the most potent in the senate; so that it
may be said with Casaubon, that the same virtue
which had brought him into distress, was the very
means of his relief, and of his exaltation to greater
dignities than those which he lost; for by the intercession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of Cato the Censor, Scipio &AElig;milianus,
who afterwards destroyed Carthage, and some other
principal noblemen, our Polybius was restored to
liberty. After which, having set it down as a
maxim, that the welfare of the Achaians consisted,
as I have said, in breaking their own stubborn inclinations,
and yielding up that freedom which
they no longer could maintain, he made it the utmost
aim of his endeavours to bring over his countrymen
to that persuasion; in which, though, to
their misfortunes, his counsels were not prevalent,
yet thereby he not only proved himself a good
patriot, but also made his fortunes with the Romans.
For his countrymen, by their own unpardonable
fault, not long afterwards drew on themselves their
own destruction; for when Mummius, in the Achaian
war, made a final conquest of that country,
he dissolved the great council of their commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
But, in the mean time, Polybius enjoyed
that tranquillity of fortune which he had purchased
by his wisdom, in that private state, being particularly
dear to Scipio and L&aelig;lius, and some of the
rest, who were then in the administration of the Roman
government. And that favour which he had
gained amongst them, he employed not in heaping
riches to himself, but as a means of performing
many considerable actions; as particularly when
Scipio was sent to demolish Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> he went
along with him in the nature of a counsellor and
companion of his enterprize. At which time, receiving
the command of a fleet from him, he made
discoveries in many parts of the Atlantic Ocean,
and especially on the shores of Africa; and<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> doing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
many good offices to all sorts of people whom he
had power to oblige, especially to the Grecians,
who, in honour of their benefactor, caused many
statues of him to be erected, as Pausanias has written.
The particular gratitude of the Locrians in
Italy is also an undeniable witness of this truth;
who, by his mediation, being discharged from the
burden of taxes which oppressed them, through the
hardship of those conditions which the Romans
had imposed on them in the treaty of peace, professed
themselves to be owing for their lives and
fortunes, to the interest only and good nature of
Polybius, which they took care to express by all
manner of acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Yet as beneficent as he was, the greatest obligement
which he could lay on human kind, was the
writing of this present history; wherein he has left
a perpetual monument of his public love to all the
world in every succeeding age of it, by giving us
such precepts as are most conducing to our common
safety and our benefit. This philanthropy (which
we have not a proper word in English to express,)
is every-where manifest in our author; and from
hence proceeded that divine rule which he gave to
Scipio,&mdash;that whensoever he went abroad, he should
take care not to return to his own house, before he
had acquired a friend by some new obligement.
To this excellency of nature we owe the treasure
which is contained in this most useful work: this
is the standard by which all good and prudent
princes ought to regulate their actions. None have
more need of friends than monarchs; and though
ingratitude is too frequent in the most of those who
are obliged, yet encouragement will work on generous
minds; and if the experiment be lost on thousands,
yet it never fails on all: and one virtuous
man in a whole nation is worth the buying, as one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
diamond is worth the search in a heap of rubbish.
But a narrow-hearted prince, who thinks that mankind
is made for him alone, puts his subjects in a
way of deserting him on the first occasion;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and
teaches them to be as sparing of their duty, as he is
of his bounty. He is sure of making enemies, who
will not be at the cost of rewarding his friends and
servants; and by letting his people see he loves
them not, instructs them to live upon the square
with him, and to make him sensible in his turn, that
prerogatives are given, but privileges are inherent.
As for tricking, cunning, and that which in sovereigns
they call king-craft, and reason of state in
commonwealths, to them and their proceedings
Polybius is an open enemy. He severely reproves
all faithless practices, and that κακοπραγμὁσυνη, or
vicious policy, which is too frequent in the management
of the public. He commends nothing
but plainness, sincerity, and the common good, undisguised,
and set in a true light before the people.
Not but that there may be a necessity of saving a
nation, by going beyond the letter of the law, or
even sometimes by superseding it; but then that
necessity must not be artificial,&mdash;it must be visible,
it must be strong enough to make the remedy not
only pardoned, but desired, to the major part of the
people; not for the interest only of some few men,
but for the public safety: for otherwise, one infringement
of a law draws after it the practice of
subverting all the liberties of a nation, which are
only entrusted with any government, but can never
be given up to it. The best way to distinguish betwixt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
a pretended necessity and a true, is to observe
if the remedy be rarely applied, or frequently; in
times of peace, or times of war and public distractions,
which are the most usual causes of sudden
necessities. From hence Casaubon infers, that this
our author, who preaches virtue, and probity, and
plain-dealing, ought to be studied principally by
kings and ministers of state; and that youth, which
are bred up to succeed in the management of business,
should read him carefully, and imbibe him
thoroughly, detesting the maxims that are given by
Machiavel and others, which are only the instruments
of tyranny. Furthermore, (continues he,)
the study of truth is perpetually joined with the
love of virtue; for there is no virtue which derives
not its original from truth; as, on the contrary,
there is no vice which has not its beginning from a
lie. Truth is the foundation of all knowledge, and
the cement of all societies; and this is one of the
most shining qualities in our author.</p>

<p>I was so strongly persuaded of this myself, in the
perusal of the present history, that I confess, amongst
all the ancients I never found any who had the air
of it so much; and amongst the moderns, none but
Philip de Commines.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> They had this common to
them, that they both changed their masters. But
Polybius changed not his side, as Philip did: he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
was not bought off to another party, but pursued
the true interest of his country, even when he served
the Romans. Yet since truth, as one of the
philosophers has told me, lies in the bottom of a
well, so it is hard to draw it up: much pains, much
diligence, much judgment is necessary to hand it
us; even cost is oftentimes required; and Polybius
was wanting in none of these.</p>

<p>We find but few historians of all ages, who have
been diligent enough in their search for truth: it is
their common method to take on trust what they
distribute to the public; by which means a falsehood
once received from a famed writer becomes
traditional to posterity. But Polybius weighed the
authors from whom he was forced to borrow the
history of the times immediately preceding his, and
oftentimes corrected them, either by comparing
them each with other, or by the lights which he had
received from ancient men of known integrity
amongst the Romans, who had been conversant in
those affairs which were then managed, and were
yet living to instruct him. He also learned the Roman
tongue; and attained to that knowledge of
their laws, their rights, their customs, and antiquities,
that few of their own citizens understood them
better: having gained permission from the senate
to search the Capitol, he made himself familiar
with their records, and afterwards translated them
into his mother-tongue. So that he taught the noblemen
of Rome their own municipal laws, and
was accounted more skilful in them than Fabius
Pictor, a man of the senatorian order, who wrote
the transactions of the Punic wars. He who neglected
none of the laws of history, was so careful
of truth, (which is the principal,) that he made it
his whole business to deliver nothing to posterity
which might deceive them; and by that diligence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
and exactness, may easily be known to be studious
of truth, and a lover of it. What therefore Brutus
thought worthy to transcribe with his own hand
out of him, I need not be ashamed to copy after
him: “I believe,” says Polybius, “that nature
herself has constituted truth as the supreme deity,
which is to be adored by mankind, and that she has
given it greater force than any of the rest; for being
opposed, as she is on all sides, and appearances of
truth so often passing for the thing itself, in behalf
of plausible falsehoods, yet by her wonderful operation
she insinuates herself into the minds of men;
sometimes exerting her strength immediately, and
sometimes lying hid in darkness for length of time;
but at last she struggles through it, and appears
triumphant over falsehood.” This sincerity Polybius
preferred to all his friends, and even to his father:
“in all other offices of life,” says he, “praise
a lover of his friends, and of his native country;
but in writing history, I am obliged to divest myself
of all other obligations, and sacrifice them all
to truth.”</p>

<p>Aratus, the Sicyonian, in the childhood of our
author, was the chief of the Achaian commonwealth;
a man in principal esteem, both in his own country
and all the provinces of Greece; admired universally
for his probity, his wisdom, his just administration,
and his conduct: in remembrance of all
which, his grateful countrymen, after his decease,
ordained him those honours which are only due to
heroes. Him our Polybius had in veneration, and
formed himself by imitation of his virtues; and is
never wanting in his commendations through the
course of his history. Yet even this man, when
the cause of truth required it, is many times reproved
by him for his slowness in counsel, his tardiness
in the beginning of his enterprises, his tedious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
and more than Spanish deliberations; and his heavy
and cowardly proceedings are as freely blamed by
our Polybius, as they were afterwards by Plutarch,
who questionless drew his character from this history.
In plain terms, that wise general scarce ever
performed any great action but by night: the glittering
of a sword before his face was offensive to
his eyes: our author therefore boldly accuses him of
his faint-heartedness; attributes the defeat at Caphi&aelig;
wholly to him; and is not sparing to affirm, that
all Peloponnesus was filled with trophies, which
were set up as the monuments of his losses. He
sometimes praises, and at other times condemns the
proceedings of Philip, king of Macedon, the son
of Demetrius, according to the occasions which he
gave him by the variety and inequality of his conduct;
and this most exquisite on either side. He
more than once arraigns him for the inconstancy of
his judgment, and chapters even his own Aratus on
the same head; shewing, by many examples, produced
from their actions, how many miseries they
had both occasioned to the Grecians; and attributing
it to the weakness of human nature, which can
make nothing perfect. But some men are brave in
battle, who are weak in counsel, which daily experience
sets before our eyes; others deliberate
wisely, but are weak in the performing part; and
even no man is the same to-day, which he was yesterday,
or may be to-morrow. On this account, says
our author, “a good man is sometimes liable to
blame, and a bad man, though not often, may possibly
deserve to be commended.” And for this very
reason he severely taxes Tim&aelig;us, a malicious historian,
who will allow no kind of virtue to Agathocles,
the tyrant of Sicily, but detracts from all his
actions, even the most glorious, because in general
he was a vicious man. “Is it to be thought,” says
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Casaubon, “that Polybius loved the memory of Agathocles,
the tyrant, or hated that of the virtuous
Aratus?” But it is one thing to commend a tyrant,
and another thing to overpass in silence those laudable
actions which are performed by him; because
it argues an author of the same falsehood, to pretermit
what has actually been done, as to feign
those actions which have never been.</p>

<p>It will not be unprofitable, in this place, to give
another famous instance of the candour and integrity
of our historian. There had been an ancient
league betwixt the republic of Achaia and the kings
of Egypt, which was entertained by both parties
sometimes on the same conditions, and sometimes
also the confederacy was renewed on other terms.
It happened, in the 148th Olympiad,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> that Ptolomy
Epiphanes, on this occasion, sent one Demetrius,
his ambassador, to the commonwealth of Achaia.
That republic was then ruinously divided into two
factions; whereof the heads on one side were Philopœmen,
and Lycortas, the father of our author;
of the adverse party, the chief was Arist&aelig;nus, with
some other principal Achaians. The faction of
Philopœmen was prevalent in the council, for renewing
the confederacy with the king of Egypt;
in order to which, Lycortas received a commission
to go to that court and treat the articles of alliance.
Accordingly, he goes, and afterwards returns, and
gives account to his superiors, that the treaty was
concluded. Arist&aelig;nus, hearing nothing but a bare
relation of a league that was made, without any
thing belonging to the conditions of it, and well
knowing that several forms of those alliances had
been used in the former negociations, asked Lycortas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
in the council, according to which of them this
present confederacy was made? To this question
of his enemy, Lycortas had not a word to answer;
for it had so happened by the wonderful neglect of
Philopœmen and his own, and also that of Ptolomy’s
counsellors, (or, as I rather believe, by their
craft contrived,) that the whole transaction had
been loosely and confusedly managed, which, in a
matter of so great importance, redounded to the
scandal and ignominy of Philopœmen and Lycortas,
in the face of that grave assembly. Now these
proceedings our author so relates, as if he had been
speaking of persons to whom he had no manner of
relation, though one of them was his own father,
and the other always esteemed by him in the place
of a better father. But being mindful of the law
which himself had instituted, concerning the indispensable
duty of an historian, (which is truth,) he
chose rather to be thought a lover of it, than of either
of his parents. It is true, Lycortas, in all probability,
was dead when Polybius wrote this history;
but, had he been then living, we may safely
think, that his son would have assumed the same
liberty, and not feared to have offended him in behalf
of truth.</p>

<p>Another part of this veracity is also deserving the
notice of the reader, though, at the same time we
must conclude, that it was also an effect of a sound
judgment, that he perpetually explodes the legends
of prodigies and miracles, and instead of them,
most accurately searches into the natural causes of
those actions which he describes; for, from the first
of these, the latter follows of direct consequence.
And for this reason, he professes an immortal enmity
to those tricks and jugglings, which the common
people believe as real miracles; because they
are ignorant of the causes which produced them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
But he had made a diligent search into them, and
found out, that they proceeded either from the fond
credulity of the people, or were imposed on them
by the craft of those whose interest it was that
they should be believed. You hear not in Polybius,
that it rained blood or stones; that a bull had spoken;
or a thousand such impossibilities, with which
Livy perpetually crowds the calends of almost every
consulship.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> His new years could no more begin
without them, during his description of the
Punic wars, than our prognosticating almanacks
without the effects of the present oppositions betwixt
Saturn and Jupiter, the foretelling of comets
and coruscations in the air, which seldom happen at
the times assigned by our astrologers, and almost
always fail in their events. If you will give credit
to some other authors, some god was always present
with Hannibal or Scipio to direct their actions;
that a visible deity wrought journey-work under
Hannibal, to conduct him through the difficult passages
of the Alps; and another did the same office
of drudgery for Scipio, when he besieged New Carthage,
by draining the water, which otherwise would
have drowned his army in their rash approaches;
which Polybius observing, says wittily and truly,
that the authors of such fabulous kind of stuff write
tragedies, not histories; for, as the poets, when they
are at a loss for the solution of a plot, bungle up
their catastrophe with a god descending in a machine,
so these inconsiderate historians, when they
have brought their heroes into a plunge by some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
rash and headlong undertaking, having no human
way remaining to disengage them with their honour,
are forced to have recourse to miracle, and
introduce a god for their deliverance. It is a common
frenzy of the ignorant multitude, says Casaubon,
to be always engaging heaven on their side;
and indeed it is a successful stratagem of any general
to gain authority among his soldiers, if he can
persuade them, that he is the man by fate appointed
for such or such an action, though most impracticable.
To be favoured of God, and command (if
it may be permitted so to say,) the extraordinary
concourse of Providence, sets off a hero, and makes
more specious the cause for which he fights, without
any consideration of morality, which ought to
be the beginning and end of all our actions; for,
where that is violated, God is only present in permission;
and suffers a wrong to be done, but not
commands it. Light historians, and such as are
superstitious in their natures, by the artifice of feigned
miracles captivate the gross understandings of
their readers, and please their fancies by relations of
things which are rather wonderful than true; but
such as are of a more profound and solid judgment,
(which is the character of our Polybius), have recourse
only to their own natural lights, and by them
pursue the methods at least of probability, if they
cannot arrive to a settled certainty. He was satisfied
that Hannibal was not the first who had made
a passage through the Alps, but that the Gauls had
been before him in their descent on Italy; and also
knew, that this most prudent general, when he laid
his design of invading that country, had made an
alliance with the Gauls, and prepossessed them in
his favour; and before he stirred a foot from Spain,
had provided against all those difficulties which he
foresaw in his attempt, and compassed his undertaking,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
which indeed was void of miracles, but full
of conduct, and military experience. In the same
manner, Scipio, before he departed from Rome, to
take his voyage into Spain, had carefully considered
every particular circumstance which might cross
his purpose, and made his enterprize as easy to him
as human prudence could provide; so that he was
victorious over that nation, not by virtue of any
miracle, but by his admirable forecast, and wise conduct
in the execution of his design. Of which,
though Polybius was not an eye-witness, he yet had
it from the best testimony, which was that of L&aelig;lius,
the friend of Scipio, who accompanied him in that
expedition; of whom our author, with great diligence;
enquired concerning every thing of moment which
happened in that war, and whom he commends for
his sincerity in that relation.</p>

<p>Whensoever he gives us the account of any considerable
action, he never fails to tell us why it
succeeded, or for what reason it miscarried; together
with all the antecedent causes of its undertaking,
and the manner of its performance; all
which he accurately explains: of which I will select
but some few instances, because I want leisure to
expatiate on many. In the fragments of the seventeenth
book he makes a learned dissertation concerning
the Macedonian phalanx, or gross body of
foot, which was formerly believed to be invincible,
till experience taught the contrary by the success
of the battle which Philip lost to the commonwealth
of Rome; and the manifest and most certain causes
are therein related, which prove it to be inferior to
the Roman legions. When also he had told us in
his former books, of the three great battles wherein
Hannibal had overthrown the Romans, and the last
at Cann&aelig;, wherein he had in a manner conquered
that republic, he gives the reasons of every defeat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
either from the choice of ground, or the strength of
the foreign horse in Hannibal’s army, or the ill-timing
of the fight on the vanquished side. After this,
when he describes the turn of fortune on the part
of the Romans, you are visibly conducted upwards
to the causes of that change, and the reasonableness
of the method which was afterwards pursued
by that commonwealth, which raised it to the empire
of the world. In these and many other examples,
which for brevity are omitted, there is nothing
more plain than that Polybius denies all power to
fortune, and places the sum of success in Providence;
συμβαινογγων τὑχην ἁιτιασθι φαυλον, indeed, are
his words, It is a madness to make fortune the
mistress of events, because in herself she is nothing,
can rule nothing, but is ruled by prudence. So
that whenever our author seems to attribute any
thing to chance, he speaks only with the vulgar,
and desires so to be understood.</p>

<p>But here I must make bold to part company with
Casaubon for a moment. He is a vehement friend
to any author with whom he has taken any pains;
and his partiality to Persius, in opposition to Juvenal,
is too fresh in my memory to be forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Because
Polybius will allow nothing to the power of
chance, he takes an occasion to infer, that he believed
a providence; sharply inveighing against
those who have accused him of atheism. He makes
Suidas his second in this quarrel; and produces his
single evidence, and that but a bare assertion,
without proof, that Polybius believed, with us
Christians, God administered all human actions and
affairs. But our author will not be defended in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
this case; his whole history reclaims to that opinion.
When he speaks of Providence, or of any
divine admonition, he is as much in jest, as when
he speaks of fortune; it is all to the capacity of the
vulgar. Prudence was the only divinity which he
worshipped, and the possession of virtue the only
end which he proposed. If I would have disguised
this to the reader, it was not in my power. The
passages which manifestly prove his irreligion are
so obvious that I need not quote them. Neither
do I know any reason why Casaubon should enlarge
so much in his justification; since to believe
false gods, and to believe none, are errors of the
same importance. He who knew not our God, saw
through the ridiculous opinions of the heathens
concerning theirs; and not being able without revelation
to go farther, stopped at home in his own
breast, and made prudence his goddess, truth his
search, and virtue his reward. If Casaubon, like
him, had followed truth, he would have saved me
the ungrateful pains of contradicting him; but
even the reputation of Polybius, if there were occasion,
is to be sacrificed to truth, according to his
own maxim.</p>

<p>As for the wisdom of our author, whereby he
wonderfully foresaw the decay of the Roman empire,
and those civil wars which turned it down
from a commonwealth to an absolute monarchy, he
who will take the pains to review this history will
easily perceive, that Polybius was of the best sort of
prophets, who predict from natural causes those
events which must naturally proceed from them.
And these things were not to succeed even in the
compass of the next century to that wherein he
lived, but the person was then living who was the
first mover towards them; and that was that great
Scipio Africanus, who, by cajoling the people to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
break the fundamental constitutions of the government
in his favour, by bringing him too early to
the consulship,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and afterwards by making their
discipline of war precarious, first taught them to
devolve the power and authority of the senate into
the hands of one, and then to make that one to be
at the disposition of the soldiery; which though he
practised at a time when it was necessary for the
safety of the commonwealth, yet it drew after it
those fatal consequences, which not only ruined
the republic, but also in process of time, the monarchy
itself. But the author was too much in the
interests of that family, to name Scipio; and therefore
he gives other reasons, to which I refer the
reader, that I may avoid prolixity.</p>

<p>By what degrees Polybius arrived to this height
of knowledge, and consummate judgment in affairs,
it will not be hard to make the reader comprehend;
for presupposing in him all that birth or nature
could give a man, who was formed for the management
of great affairs, and capable of recording them,
he was likewise entered from his youth into those employments
which add experience to natural endowments;
being joined in commission with his father
Lycortas, and the younger Aratus, before the age
of twenty, in an embassy to Egypt: after which he
was perpetually in the business of his own commonwealth,
or that of Rome. So that it seems to be
one part of the Roman felicity, that he was born in
an age when their commonwealth was growing to
the height; that he might be the historian of those
great actions, which were performed not only in his
lifetime, but the chief of them even in his sight.</p>

<p>I must confess, that the preparations to his history,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
or the Prolegomena, as they are called, are
very large, and the digressions in it are exceeding
frequent. But as to his preparatives, they were
but necessary to make the reader comprehend the
drift and design of his undertaking: and the digressions
are also so instructive, that we may truly
say, they transcend the profit which we receive
from the matter of fact. Upon the whole, we may
conclude him to be a great talker; but we must
grant him to be a prudent man. We can spare nothing
of all he says, it is so much to our improvement;
and if the rest of his history had remained
to us, in all probability it would have been more
close: for we can scarce conceive what was left in
nature for him to add, he has so emptied almost all
the common-places of digressions already; or if he
could have added any thing, those observations
might have been as useful and as necessary as the
rest which he has given us, and that are descended
to our hands.</p>

<p>I will say nothing farther of the “Excerpta,”
which (as Casaubon thinks,) are part of that epitome
which was begun to be made by Marcus Brutus,
but never finished; nor of those embassies which
are collected and compiled by the command of
Constantine the Great; because neither of them
are translated in this work. And whether or no
they will be added in another impression, I am not
certain; the translator of these five books having
carried his work no farther than it was perfect.
He, I suppose, will acquaint you with his own
purpose, in the preface which I hear he intends to
prefix before Polybius.</p>

<p>Let us now hear Polybius himself describing an
accomplished historian, wherein we shall see his
own picture, as in a glass, reflected to him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
given us afterwards to behold in the writing of
this history.</p>

<p>Plato said of old, that it would be happy for
mankind, if either philosophers administered the
government, or that governors applied themselves
to the study of philosophy. I may also say, that
it would be happy for history, if those who undertake
to write it, were men conversant in political
affairs; who applied themselves seriously to their
undertaking, not negligently, but as such who
were fully persuaded that they undertook a work
of the greatest moment, of the greatest excellency,
and the most necessary for mankind; establishing
this as the foundation whereon they are to
build, that they can never be capable of performing
their duty as they ought, unless they have formed
themselves beforehand to their undertaking, by
prudence, and long experience of affairs; without
which endowments and advantages, if they attempt
to write a history, they will fall into a various and
endless labyrinth of errors.</p>

<p>When we hear this author speaking, we are
ready to think ourselves engaged in a conversation
with Cato the Censor, with L&aelig;lius, with Massinissa,
and with the two Scipios; that is, with the greatest
heroes and most prudent men of the greatest age
in the Roman commonwealth. This sets me so on
fire, when I am reading either here, or in any
ancient author, their lives and actions, that I cannot
hold from breaking out with Montagne into
this expression: “It is just,” says he, “for every
honest man to be content with the government
and laws of his native country, without endeavouring
to alter or subvert them; but if I were to choose,
where I would have been born, it should have been
in a commonwealth.” He indeed names Venice,
which, for many reasons, should not be my wish;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
but rather Rome in such an age, if it were possible,
as that wherein Polybius lived; or that of Sparta,
whose constitution for a republic, is by our author
compared with Rome, to which he justly gives the
preference.</p>

<p>I will not undertake to compare Polybius and
Tacitus; though, if I should attempt it upon the
whole merits of the cause, I must allow to Polybius
the greater comprehension, and the larger soul; to
Tacitus, the greater eloquence, and the more close
connection of his thoughts. The manner of Tacitus
in writing is more like the force and gravity of Demosthenes;
that of Polybius more like the copiousness
and diffusive character of Cicero. Amongst
historians, Tacitus imitated Thucydides, and Polybius,
Herodotus. Polybius foresaw the ruin of the
Roman commonwealth, by luxury, lust, and cruelty;
Tacitus foresaw in the causes those events
which would destroy the monarchy. They are
both of them, without dispute, the best historians
in their several kinds. In this they are alike, that
both of them suffered under the iniquity of the
times in which they lived; both their histories are
dismembered, the greatest part of them lost, and
they are interpolated in many places. Had their
works been perfect, we might have had longer histories,
but not better. Casaubon, according to his
usual partiality, condemns Tacitus that he may raise
Polybius; who needs not any sinister artifice to
make him appear equal to the best. Tacitus described
the times of tyranny; but he always writes
with some kind of indignation against them. It is
not his fault that Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian, were bad princes. He is accused of
malevolence, and of taking actions in the worst
sense: but we are still to remember, that those were
the actions of tyrants. Had the rest of his history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
remained to us, we had certainly found a better
account of Vespasian, Titus, Nerva, and Trajan,
who were virtuous emperors; and he would have
given the principles of their actions a contrary turn.
But it is not my business to defend Tacitus; neither
dare I decide the preference betwixt him and our
Polybius. They are equally profitable and instructive
to the reader; but Tacitus more useful to those
who are born under a monarchy, Polybius to those
who live in a republic.</p>

<p>What may farther be added concerning the history
of this author, I leave to be performed by the
elegant translator of his work.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>

<p>The Dialogues of Lucian were translated by Walter Moyle,
Sir Henry Shere, Charles Blount, and others, and seem to have
been intended for publication about 1696, when our author supplied
the following prefatory life. The design was, however, for
a time laid aside, and the work did not appear until 1711 several
years after Dryden’s death. Hence the preface wants those last corrections,
which, I suspect, Dryden contented himself with bestowing
upon the proof sheets, as they came from press. I have followed several
of Mr Malone’s judicious, and indeed indispensable,
corrections of the printed copy.

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />
LIFE OF LUCIAN.</h2>


<p>The writing a life is at all times, and in all circumstances,
the most difficult task of an historian;
and, notwithstanding the numerous tribe of biographers,
we can scarce find one, except Plutarch, who
deserves our perusal, or can invite a second view.
But if the difficulty be so great where the materials
are plentiful, and the incidents extraordinary, what
must it be when the person, that affords the subject,
denies matter enough for a page? The learned
seldom abound with action, and it is action only
that furnishes the historian with things agreeable
and instructive. It is true, that Diogenes Laertius,
and our learned countryman Mr Stanley,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> have
both written the “Lives of the Philosophers;” but
we are more obliged to the various principles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
their several sects, than to any thing remarkable
that they did, for our entertainment.</p>

<p>But Lucian, as pleasing and useful as he was in
his writings, in the opinion of the most candid
judges, has left so little of his own affairs on record,
that there is scarce sufficient to fill a page, from his
birth to his death.</p>

<p>There were many of the name of Lucian among
the ancients, eminent in several ways, and whose
names have reached posterity with honour and applause.
Suidas mentions one, as a man of singular
probity, who, having discharged the administration
of the chief prefect of the Oriental empire,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> under
Arcadius, with extraordinary justice and praise of
the people, drew on himself the envy and hate of
the courtiers, (the constant attendant of eminent
virtue and merit,) and the anger of the emperor
himself; and was at last murdered by Rufinus.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>Among those, who were eminent for their learning,
were some divines and philosophers. Of the
former, we find one in St Cyprian, to whom the
fourth and seventeenth epistles are inscribed. There
was another, priest of the church of Antioch, who,
as Suidas assures us, reviewed, corrected, and restored
to its primitive purity, the Hebrew Bible;
and afterward suffered martyrdom, at Nicomedia,
under Maximilian.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> A third was a priest of Jerusalem,
who not only made a figure among the learned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of his own age,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> but, as Gesnerus observes, conveyed
his reputation to posterity by the remains of
his writings.</p>

<p>But none of this name has met with the general
applause of so many ages, as Lucian the philosopher
and eminent sophist, who was author of the
following Dialogues, of whose birth, life, and
death, I shall give you all I could collect of any
certain and historical credit.</p>

<p>He had not the good fortune to be born of illustrious
or wealthy parents, which give a man a very
advantageous rise on his first appearance in the
world; but the father of our Lucian laboured under
so great a straitness of estate, that he was fain to
put his son apprentice to a statuary, whose genius
for the finer studies was so extraordinary and so
rare; because he hoped from that business, not only
a speedy supply to his own wants, but was secure
that his education in that art would be much less
expensive to him.</p>

<p>He was born in Samosata, a city of Syria, not far
from the river Euphrates; and for this reason, he
calls himself more than once an Assyrian, and a
Syrian; but he was derived from a Greek original,
his forefathers having been citizens of Patras in
Achaia.</p>

<p>We have nothing certain as to the exact time of
his birth. Suidas confirms his flourishing under the
Emperor Trajan; but then he was likewise before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
him. Some mention the reign of Adrian; but it
cannot be fixed to any year or consulate.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The person he was bound to was his uncle, a man
of a severe and morose temper, of whom he was to
learn the statuary’s and stone-cutter’s art; for his
father observing our Lucian, now a boy, of his own
head, and without any instructor, make various figures
in wax, he persuaded himself, that if he had
a good master, he could not but arrive to an uncommon
excellence in it.</p>

<p>But it happened, in the very beginning of his
time, he broke a model, and was very severely called
to account for it by his master. He, not liking
this treatment, and having a soul and genius above
any mechanic trade, ran away home.</p>

<p>After which, in his sleep, there appeared to him
two young women, or rather the tutelar goddesses
of the statuary art, and of the liberal sciences, hotly
disputing of their preference to each other; and on
a full hearing of both sides, he bids adieu to statuary,
and entirely surrenders himself to the conduct
of virtue and learning. And as his desires of improvement
were great, and the instructions he had,
very good, the progress he made was as considerable,
till, by the maturity of his age and his study,
he made his appearance in the world.</p>

<p>Though it is not to be supposed, that there is any
thing of reality in this dream, or vision, of Lucian,
which he treats of in his works, yet this may be
gathered from it,&mdash;that Lucian himself, having consulted
his genius, and the nature of the study his
father had allotted him, and that to which he found
a propensity in himself, he quitted the former, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
pursued the latter, choosing rather to form the
minds of men than their statues.</p>

<p>In his youth, he taught rhetoric in Gaul, and in
several other places. He pleaded likewise at the
bar in Antioch, the capital of Syria; but the noise
of the bar disgusting, and his ill success in causes
disheartening him, he quitted the practice of rhetoric
and the law, and applied himself to writing.</p>

<p>He was forty years old, when he first took to
philosophy. Having a mind to make himself known
in Macedon, he took the opportunity of speaking
in the public assembly of all that region. In his
old age, he was received into the imperial family,
and had the place of intendant of Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> after he
had travelled through almost all the known countries
of that age to improve his knowledge in men,
manners, and arts; for some writers make this particular
observation on his travel into Gaul, and residence
in that country, that he gained there the
greatest part of his knowledge in rhetoric, that region
being in his age, and also before it, a nursery
of eloquence and oratory, as Juvenal, Martial, and
others, sufficiently witness.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The manner of his death is obscure to us, though
it is most probable he died of the gout. Suidas
alone tells a story of his being worried to death, and
devoured by dogs, returning from a feast; which
being so uncommon a death, so very improbable,
and attested only by one author, has found little
credit with posterity. If it be true, that he was
once a Christian, and afterwards became a renegade
to our belief, perhaps some zealots may have invented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
this tale of his death, as a just and signal
punishment for his apostacy. All men are willing
to have the miracle, or at least the wonderful providence,
go on their side, and will be teaching God
Almighty what he ought to do in this world, as
well as in the next; as if they were proper judges
of his decrees, and for what end he prospers some,
or punishes others, in this life. Ablancourt, and
our learned countryman Dr Mayne,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> look on the
story as a fiction: and, for my part, I can see no
reason either to believe he ever professed Christianity,
or, if he did, why he might<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> not more probably
die in his bed at so great an age as fourscore
and ten, than be torn in pieces and devoured by
dogs, when he was too feeble to defend himself.
So early began the want of charity, the presumption
of meddling with God’s government, and the spirit
of calumny amongst the primitive believers.</p>

<p>Of his posterity we know nothing more, than
that he left a son behind him, who was as much in
favour with the Emperor Julian, as his father had
been with Aurelius the philosopher. This son became
in time a famous sophist; and among the
works of Julian we find an epistle of that great person
to him.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>I find that I have mingled, before I was aware,
some things which are doubtful with some which
are certain; forced indeed by the narrowness of the
subject, which affords very little of undisputed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
truth. Yet I find myself obliged to do right to
Monsieur d’Ablancourt,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> who is not positively of
opinion, that Suidas was the author of this fable;
but rather that it descended to him by the tradition
of former times, yet without any certain ground
of truth. He concludes it, however, to be a calumny,
perhaps a charitable kind of lie, to deter
others from satirizing the new dogmas of Christianity,
by the judgment shown on Lucian. We
find nothing in his writings, which gives any hint
of his professing our belief; but being naturally curious,
and living not only amongst Christians, but
in the neighbourhood of Judea, he might reasonably
be supposed to be knowing in our points of faith,
without believing them. He ran a muck, and laid
about him on all sides with more fury on the heathens,
whose religion he professed; he struck at
ours but casually, as it came in his way, rather than
as he sought it; he contemned it too much to write
in earnest against it.</p>

<p>We have indeed the highest probabilities for our
revealed religion; arguments which will preponderate
with a reasonable man, upon a long and careful
disquisition; but I have always been of opinion,
that we can demonstrate nothing, because the subject-matter
is not capable of a demonstration. It
is the particular grace of God, that any man believes
the mysteries of our faith; which I think a
conclusive argument against the doctrine of persecution
in any church. And though I am absolutely
convinced, as I heartily thank God I am, not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
of the general principles of Christianity, but of all
truths necessary to salvation in the Roman church,
yet I cannot but detest our inquisition, as it is practised
in some foreign parts, particularly in Spain
and in the Indies.</p>

<p>Those reasons, which are cogent to me, may not
prevail with others, who bear the denomination of
Christians; and those which are prevalent with all
Christians, in regard of their birth and education,
may find no force, when they are used against Mahometans
or heathens. To instruct is a charitable
duty; to compel, by threatenings and punishment,
is the office of a hangman, and the principle of a
tyrant.</p>

<p>But my zeal in a good cause, as I believe, has
transported me beyond the limits of my subject. I
was endeavouring to prove, that Lucian had never
been a member of the Christian church; and methinks
it makes for my opinion, that, in relating
the death of Peregrinus, who, being born a Pagan,
pretended afterwards to turn Christian, and turned
himself publicly at the Olympic games, at his
death professing himself a cynic philosopher, it
seems, I say, to me, that Lucian would not have so
severely declaimed against this Proteus, (which was
another of Peregrinus his names,) if he himself had
been guilty of that apostacy.</p>

<p>I know not that this passage has been observed
by any man before me;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and yet in this very place
it is, that this author has more severely handled our
belief, and more at large, than in any other part of
all his writings, excepting only the Dialogue of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Triephon and Critias,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> wherein he lashes his own
false gods with more severity than the true; and
where the first Christians, with their cropped hair,
their whining voices, melancholy faces, mournful discourses,
and nasty habits, are described with a greater
air of Calvinists or Quakers, than of Roman Catholics
or Church of England men.</p>

<p>After all, what if this discourse last mentioned,
and the rest of the dialogues wherein the Christians
are satirized, were none of Lucian’s? The learned
and ingenious Dr Mayne, whom I have before cited,
is of this opinion, and confirms it by the attestation
of Philander, Obsobœus, Mycillus, and Cognatus,
whom since I have not read, or two of them but
very superficially, I refer you for the faith of his
quotation to the authors themselves.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The next supposition concerning Lucian’s religion
is, that he was of none at all. I doubt not but
the same people, who broached the story of his being
once a Christian, followed their blow upon him
in this second accusation.</p>

<p>There are several sorts of Christians at this day
reigning in the world, who will not allow any man
to believe in the Son of God, whose other articles
of faith are not in all things conformable to theirs.
Some of these exercise this rigid and severe kind of
charity, with a good intent of reducing several sects
into one common church; but the spirit of others
is evidently seen by their detraction, their malice,
their spitting venom, their raising false reports of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
those who are not of their communion. I wish the
ancientness of these censorious principles may be
proved by better arguments, than by any near resemblance
they have with the primitive believers.
But till I am convinced that Lucian has been charged
with atheism of old, I shall be apt to think that
this accusation is very modern.</p>

<p>One of Lucian’s translators pleads in his defence,
that it was very improbable a man, who has laughed
paganism out of doors, should believe no God;
that he, who could point to the sepulchre of Jupiter
in Crete, as well as our Tertullian, should be an
atheist. But this argument, I confess, is of little
weight to prove him a deist, only because he was
no polytheist. He might as well believe in none,
as in many gods; and on the other side, he might
believe in many, as Julian did, and not in one. For
my own part, I think it is not proved that either of
them were apostates, though one of them, in hopes
of an empire, might temporize, while Christianity
was the mode at court. Neither is our author cleared
any thing the more, because his writings have
served, in the times of the heathens, to destroy that
vain, unreasonable, and impious religion; <i>that</i> was
an oblique service, which Lucian never intended us;
for his business, like that of some modern polemics,
was rather to pull down every thing, than to set up
any thing. With what show of probability can I
urge in his defence, that one of the greatest among
the fathers has drawn whole homilies from our author’s
dialogue, since I know that Lucian made
them not for that purpose? The occasional good
which he has done, is not to be imputed to him.
St Chrysostom, St Augustin, and many others, have
applied his arguments on better motives than their
author proposed to himself in framing them.</p>

<p>These reasons therefore, as they make nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
against his being an atheist, so they prove nothing
of his believing one God; but only leave him as
they found him, and leave us in as great an obscurity
concerning his religion as before. I may be as
much mistaken in my opinion as these great men
have been before me; and this is very probable,
because I know less of him than they; yet I have
read him over more than once, and therefore will
presume to say, that I think him either one of the
Eclectic<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> school, or else a Sceptic: I mean, that
he either formed a body of philosophy for his own
use out of the opinions and dogmas of several heathen
philosophers, disagreeing amongst themselves,
or that he doubted of every thing; weighed all
opinions, and adhered to none of them; only used
them as they served his occasion for the present
dialogue, and perhaps rejected them in the next.
And indeed this last opinion is the more probable
of the two, if we consider the genius of the man,
whose image we may clearly see in the glass which
he holds before us of his writings, which reflects
him to our sight.</p>

<p>Not to dwell on examples, with which his works
are amply furnished, I will only mention two. In
one, Socrates convinces his friend Ch&aelig;rephon of
the power of the gods in transformations, and of a
supreme Providence which accompanies that power
in the administration of the world. In another, he
confutes Jupiter, and pulls him down from heaven
to earth, by his own Homerical chain; and makes
him only a subservient slave to blind eternal fate.
I might add, that he is, in one half of his book, a
Stoic, in the other an Epicurean; never constant
to himself in any scheme of divinity, unless it be in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
despising his gentile gods. And this derision, as it
shews the man himself, so it gives us an idea of the
age in which he lived; for if that had been devout
or ignorant, his scoffing humour would either have
been restrained, or had not passed unpunished; all
knowing ages being naturally sceptic, and not at
all bigotted; which, if I am not much deceived, is
the proper character of our own.</p>

<p>To conclude this article: He was too fantastical,
too giddy, too irresolute, either to be any thing at
all, or any thing long; and in this view I cannot
think he was either a steady atheist, or a deist, but
a doubter, a sceptic, as he plainly declares himself
to be, when he puts himself under the name of Hermotimus
the Stoic, in the dialogue called the “Dialogue
of the Sects.”</p>

<p>As for his morals, they are spoken of as variously
as his opinions. Some are for decrying him more
than he deserves; his defenders themselves dare not
set him up for a pattern of severe virtue. No man
is so profligate, as openly to profess vice; and therefore
it is no wonder, if under the reign of Nerva,
Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines, of which
the last was his patron and benefactor, he lived not
so much a libertine as he had it to be in his nature.
He is more accused for his love of boys than of women.
Not that we have any particular story to
convince us of this detestable passion in him; but
his own writings bear this record against him, that
he speaks often of it, and I know not that ever he
condemns it. Repeated expressions, as well as repeated
actions, witness some secret pleasure in the
deed, or at least some secret inclination to it. He
seems to insinuate, in his “Dialogue of Loves,”
that Socrates was given to this vice; but we find
not that he blames him for it, which, if he had been
wholly innocent himself, it became a philosopher to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
have done. But as we pass over a foul way as hastily
as we can, so I will leave this abominable subject,
which strikes me with horror when I name
it.</p>

<p>If there be any who are guilty of this sin, we
may assure ourselves they will never stop at any
other; for when they have overleaped the bounds
of nature, they run so fast to all other immoralities,
that the grace of God, without a miracle, can never
overtake them.</p>

<p>Lucian is accused likewise for his writing too
lusciously in his “Dialogue of the Harlots.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It
has been the common fault of all satirists, to make
vice too amiable, while they expose it; but of all
men living, I am the most unfit to accuse Lucian,
who am so little able to defend myself from the
same objection. We find not, however, that Lucian
was charged with the wantonness of his “Dialogues”
in his own life-time. If he had been, he
would certainly have answered for himself, as he
did to those who accused him for exposing Socrates,
Plato, Diogenes, and other great philosophers, to
the laughter of the people, when Jupiter sold them
by an inch of candle. But, to confess the truth,
[as] I am of their opinion, who think that answer
of his not over-ingenuous, viz. that he only attacked
the false philosophers of their sects, in their persons
whom he honoured; so I am persuaded, that
he could not have alleged more in his excuse for
these “Dialogues,” than that as he taught harlots
to deceive, so, at the same time, he discovered their
deceits to the knowledge of young men, and thereby
warned them to avoid the snare.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>I find him not charged with any other faults,
than what I have already mentioned. He was
otherwise of a life as unblameable as any man, for
aught we find to the contrary: and I have this
probable inducement to believe it, because he had
so honourable an employment under Marcus Aurelius,
an emperor as clear-sighted as he was truly virtuous;
for both which qualities we need not quote
Lucian, who was so much obliged to him, but may
securely appeal to Herodian, and to all the historians
who have written of him,&mdash;besides the testimony
of his own admirable works, which are yet in the
hands of all the learned.</p>

<p>As for those who condemn our author for the too
much gall and virulency of his satires, it is to be
suspected, says Dr Mayne, that they themselves
are guilty of those hypocrisies, crimes, and follies,
which he so sharply exposes, and at the same time
endeavours to reform. I may add, that, for the most
part, he rather laughs like Horace, than bites like
Juvenal. Indeed his genius was of kin to both,
but more nearly related to the former. Some diseases
are curable by lenitives; to others corrosives
are necessary. Can a man inveigh too sharply
against the cruelty of tyrants, the pride and vanity
of the great, the covetousness of the rich, the baseness
of the Sophists, and particularly of the Cynics,
(who while they preach poverty to others, are
heaping up riches, and living in gluttony,) besides
the wrangling of the sects amongst themselves
about supreme happiness, which he describes at
a drunken feast, and calls it the battle of the Lapith&aelig;.</p>

<p>Excepting what already is excepted, he seems to
me to be an enemy to nothing but to vice and folly.
The pictures which he draws of Nigrinus and of
Demonax are as fair as that of virtue herself, if, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the philosopher said, she could wear a body. And
if we oppose to them the lives of Alexander the
false prophet, and of Peregrinus, how pleasingly,
and with how much profit, does the deformity of
the last set off the beauty of the first!</p>

<p>Some of his censurers accuse him of flatness and
want of wit in many places. These I suppose have
read him in some Latin translations, which I confess,
are generally dull; and this is the only excuse
I can make for them. Otherwise they accuse themselves
too manifestly for want of taste or understanding.
Of this number is the wretched author
of the <i>Lucien en Belle Humeur</i>, who being himself
as insipid as a Dutch poet, yet arraigns Lucian for
his own fault; introduces the ghost of Ablancourt,
confessing his coldness in many places, the poorness
of his thoughts, and his want of humour; represents
his readers tired and yawning at his ill
buffoonery and false mirth, and sleeping over his
melancholic stories, which are every where stuffed
with improbabilities. He could have said no worse
of a Leyden slip.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>The best on it is, the jaundice is only in his own
eyes, which makes Lucian look yellow to him. All
mankind will exclaim against him for preaching
this doctrine; and be of opinion when they read
his Lucian, that he looked in a glass when he drew
his picture. I wish I had the liberty to lash this
frog-land wit as he deserves; but when a speech is
not seconded in parliament, it falls of course; and
this author has the whole senate of the learned to
pull him down: <i>incipient omnes pro Cicerone loqui</i>.</p>

<p>It is to be acknowledged, that his best translator,
Ablancourt, thinks him not a profound master in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
any sort of philosophy; but only that he skimmed
enough from every sect, to serve his turn in rhetoric,
which was his profession. This he gathers
from his superficial way of arguing. But why may
not another man reply in his defence, that he made
choice of those kinds of reasons which were most
capable of being made to shine in his facetious way
of arguing; and those undoubtedly were not the
most knotty, nor the deepest, but the most diverting
by the sharpness of the raillery. Dr Mayne, so
often praised, has another opinion of Lucian’s learning,
and the strength of his witty arguments, concluding
on that subject in these words, or near
them: “For my part, I know not to whose writings
we owe more our Christianity, where the true God
has succeeded a multitude of false,&mdash;whether to the
grave confutation of Clemens Alexandrinus, Arnobius,
Justin Martyr, St. Augustin, Lactantius, &amp;c.
or the facetious wit of Lucian.”&mdash;I cannot doubt
but the treacherous translator would have given his
hand to what the Englishman has said of their
common author. The success has justified his opinion
in the sight of all the world. Lucian’s manner
of convincing, was certainly more pleasant than
that of the Christian writers, and we know the
effect was full as powerful; so easily can the Eternal
Wisdom draw good out of evil, and make his
enemy subservient to the establishment of his
faith.</p>

<p>I will not enlarge on the praises of his oratory.
If we compare his style with the Greek historians,
his contemporaries, or near his time, we shall find
it much more pure than that of Plutarch, Dion, or
Appian, though not so grave; because his subjects
and theirs required to be treated after a different
manner. It was not of an uniform web, says Mayne,
like Thucydides, Polybius, and some others whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
he names, but was somewhat peculiar to himself;
his words well chosen, his periods round, the parts
of his sentences harmoniously divided, a full flood
or even a torrent of persuasion, without inequalities
or swellings; such as might be put in equal comparison
with the best orations of Demosthenes
or Isocrates; not so dry as the first, nor so flowery
as the last. His wit, says Ablancourt, was full of
urbanity, that attic salt, which the French call,
fine raillery; not obscene, not gross, not rude, but
facetious, well mannered, and well bred: only he
will not allow his love the quality last mentioned,
but thinks it rustical, and according either to his
own genius, or that of the age in which he lived.</p>

<p>If wit consists in the propriety of thoughts and
words, (which I imagined I had first found out, but
since am pleasingly convinced that Aristotle has
made the same definition in other terms,) then Lucian’s
thoughts and words are always proper to his
characters and his subject. If the pleasure arising
from comedy and satire be either laughter, or some
nobler sort of delight, which is above it, no man is
so great a master of irony as our author. That figure
is not only a keen, but a shining weapon in his
hand; it glitters in the eyes of those it kills; his own
gods, his greatest enemies, are not butchered by him,
but fairly slain: they must acknowledge the hero
in the stroke, and take the comfort which Virgil
gives to a dying captain:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>&AElig;ne&aelig; magni dextr&acirc; cadis.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I know not whom Lucian imitated, unless it
might be Aristophanes; (for you never find him
mentioning any Roman wit, so much the Grecians
thought themselves superior to their conquerors;)
but he, who has best imitated him in Latin, is Erasmus;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and in French, Fontenelle, in his “Dialogues
of the Dead,” which I never read but with a new
pleasure.</p>

<p>Any one may see, that our author’s chief design
was to dis-nest heaven of so many immoral and debauched
deities; his next, to expose the mock philosophers;
and his last, to give us examples of a
good life in the persons of the true.</p>

<p>The rest of his discourses are on mixed subjects,
less for profit than delight; and some of them too
libertine.</p>

<p>The way which Lucian chose of delivering these
profitable and pleasing truths, was that of dialogue:
a choice worthy of the author; happily followed,
as I said above, by Erasmus, and Fontenelle particularly,
to whom I may justly add a triumvir of our
own,&mdash;the reverend, ingenious, and learned Dr
Eachard,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> who, by using the same method, and the
same ingredients of raillery and reason, has more
baffled the philosopher of Malmesbury, than those
who assaulted him with blunt heavy arguments,
drawn from orthodox divinity; for Hobbes foresaw
where those strokes would fall, and leaped aside before
they could descend; but he could not avoid
those nimble passes, which were made on him by a
wit more active than his own, and which were
within his body, before he could provide for his defence.</p>

<p>I will not here take notice of the several kinds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
dialogue, and the whole art of it, which would ask
an entire volume to perform. This has been a work
long wanted, and much desired, of which the ancients
have not sufficiently informed us; and I
question whether any man now living can treat it
accurately. Lucian, it seems, was very sensible of
the difficult task, which he undertook in writing
dialogues, as appears in his discourse against one
who had called him Prometheus. He owns himself,
in this particular, to be like to him, to whom
he was resembled, to be the inventor of a new work,
attempted in a new manner,&mdash;the model of which
he had from none before him; but adds withal, that
if he could not give it the graces which belong to
so happy an invention, he deserves to be torn by
twelve vultures, instead of one, which preys upon
the heart of that first man-potter. For, to quit the
beaten road of the ancients, and take a path of his
own choosing, he acknowledges to be a bold and
ridiculous attempt, if it succeed not. “The mirth
of dialogue and comedy in my work,” says he, “is
not enough to make it pleasing, because the union
of two contraries may as well produce a monster as
a miracle; as a centaur results from the joint natures
of a horse and man. It is not but that from
two excellent beings a third may arise of perfect
beauty; but it is what I dare not promise to myself;
for dialogue being a solemn entertainment of
grave discourse, and comedy the wit and fooling
of a theatre, I fear that through the corruption of
two good things, I have made one bad. But
whatever the child be, it is my own at least; I beg
not with another’s brat upon my back. From which
of the ancients should I have stolen or borrowed
it? My chimeras have no other being than my
own imagination; let every man produce who can;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and whether this be a lawful birth, or a misshapen
mass, is left for the present age, and for posterity,
to judge.”</p>

<p>This is the sense of my author’s words contracted
in a narrow compass; for, if you will believe
Ablancourt, and others, his greatest fault is, that he
exhausts his argument,&mdash;like Ovid, knows not when
to give over, but is perpetually galloping beyond
his stage.</p>

<p>But though I cannot pursue our author any farther,
I find myself obliged to say something of those
translators of the following Dialogues, whom I have
the honour to know, as well as of some other translations
of this author; and a word or two of translation
itself.</p>

<p>As for the translators, all of them, that I know,
are men of established reputation, both for wit and
learning, at least sufficiently known to be so among
all the finer spirits of the age. Sir Henry Sheers
has given many proofs of his excellence in this kind;
for while we, by his admirable address, enjoy Polybius
in our mother tongue, we can never forget the
hand that bestowed the benefit. The learning and
judgment above his age, which every one discovers
in Mr Moyle,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> are proofs of those abilities he has
shewn in his country’s service, when he was chose
to serve it in the senate, as his father had done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
The wit of Mr Blount,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and his other performances,
need no recommendation from me; they have made
too much noise in the world to need a herald. There
are some other persons concerned in this work,
whose names deserve a place among the foremost,
but that they have not thought fit to be known,
either out of a bashful diffidence of their own performance,
or out of apprehension of the censure of
an ill-natured and ill-judging age; for criticism is
now become mere hangman’s work, and meddles
only with the faults of authors; nay, the critic is
disgusted less with their absurdities than excellence;
and you cannot displease him more than in
leaving him little room for his malice, in your correctness
and perfection; though that indeed is what
he never allows any man; for, like the bed of Procrustes,
they stretch or cut off an author to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
length. These spoilers of Parnassus are a just excuse
for concealing the name, since most of their
malice is levelled more at the person than the thing;
and as a sure mark of their judgment, they will extol
to the skies the anonymous work of a person
they will not allow to write common sense.</p>

<p>But this consideration of our modern critics has
led me astray, and made me insensibly deviate from
the subject before me; the modesty or caution of
the anonymous translators of the following work.
Whatever the motive of concealing their names
may be, I shall not determine; but it is certain, nothing
could more contribute to make a perfect version
of Lucian, than a confederacy of many men of
parts and learning to do him justice. It seems a
task too hard for any one to undertake; the burden
would indeed be insupportable, unless we did what
the French have done in some of their translations,
allow twenty years to perfect the work, and bestow
all the brightest intervals, the most sprightly hours,
to polish and finish the work.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>But this has not been the fate of our author
hitherto; for Lucian, that is the sincere example
of attic eloquence, as Gr&aelig;vius says of him, is only
a mass of solecism, and mere vulgarisms in Mr
Spence.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> I do not think it worth my while to
rake into the filth of so scandalous a version; nor
had I vouchsafed so much as to take notice of it,
had it not been so gross an affront to the memory
of Lucian, and so great a scandal to our nation.
D’Ablancourt has taken a great deal of pains to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
furnish this intruder into print, with Lucian, in a
language more known to him than Greek; nay, he
has left him not one crabbed idiom to study for,
since he has admirably clothed him in a garb more
familiar to the moderns, still keeping the sense of
his author in view. But in spite of all these helps,
these leading-strings were not sufficient to keep
Mr Spence from falling to the ground every step
he made; while he makes him speak in the style
and language of a jack-pudding, not a master of
eloquence, admired for it through all the ages since
he wrote. But too much of this trifler.</p>

<p>I have said enough already of the version of the
learned Dr Mayne, to shew my approbation of it;
but it is only a select parcel of Lucian’s Dialogues
which pleased him most, but far from the whole.
As for any other translation, if there be any such
in our language, it is what I never saw,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and suppose
it must be antiquated, or of so inferior a degree,
as not even to rival Spence.</p>

<p>The present translation, as far as I can judge by
what I have seen, is no way inferior to Ablancourt’s,
and in many things is superior. It has indeed
the advantage of appearing in a language
more strong and expressive than French, and by
the hands of gentlemen who perfectly understand
him and their own language.</p>

<p>This has brought me to say a word or two about
translation in general; in which no nation might
more excel than the English, though, as matters
are now managed, we come so far short of the
French. There may indeed be a reason assigned,
which bears a very great probability; and that is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
that here the booksellers are the undertakers of
works of this nature, and they are persons more
devoted to their own gain than the public honour.
They are very parsimonious in rewarding
the wretched scribblers they employ; and care
not how the business is done, so that it be but
done. They live by selling titles, not books; and
if that carry off one impression, they have their
ends, and value not the curses they and their
authors meet with from the bubbled chapmen.
While translations are thus at the disposal of the
booksellers, and have no better judges or rewarders
of the performance, it is impossible that we should
make any progress in an art so very useful to an
enquiring people, and for the improvement and
spreading of knowledge, which is none of the
worst preservatives against slavery.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that when the bookseller
has interest with gentlemen of genius and quality,
above the mercenary prospects of little writers, as
in that of Plutarch’s Lives,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and this of Lucian,
the reader may satisfy himself that he shall have
the author’s spirit and soul in the traduction.
These gentlemen know very well, that they are
not to creep after the words of their author, in so
servile a manner as some have done; for that
must infallibly throw them on a necessity of introducing
a new mode of diction and phraseology
with which we are not at all acquainted, and would
incur that censure which my Lord Dorset made
formerly on those of Mr Spence, viz. that he was
so cunning a translator, that a man must consult
the original, to understand the version. For every
language has a propriety and idiom peculiar to itself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
which cannot be conveyed to another without
perpetual absurdities.</p>

<p>The qualification of a translator, worth reading,
must be, a mastery of the language he translates
out of, and that he translates into; but if a deficience
be to be allowed in either, it is in the
original; since if he be but master enough of the
tongue of his author, as to be master of his sense,
it is possible for him to express that sense with
eloquence in his own, if he have a thorough command
of that. But without the latter, he can
never arrive at the useful and the delightful;
without which reading is a penance and fatigue.</p>

<p>It is true that there will be a great many beauties,
which in every tongue depend on the diction,
that will be lost<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> in the version of a man not
skilled in the original language of the author; but
then on the other side, first it is impossible to render
all those little ornaments of speech in any two languages;
and if he have a mastery in the sense and
spirit of his author, and in his own language have
a style and happiness of expression, he will easily
supply all that is lost by that defect.</p>

<p>A translator that would write with any force or
spirit of an original, must never dwell on the words
of his author. He ought to possess himself entirely,
and perfectly comprehend the genius and sense
of his author, the nature of the subject, and the
terms of the art or subject treated of; and then he
will express himself as justly, and with as much
life, as if he wrote an original; whereas, he who
copies word for word, loses all the spirit in the
tedious transfusion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>I would not be understood that he should be at
liberty to give such a turn as Mr Spence has in
some of his; where for the fine raillery and attic
salt of Lucian, we find the gross expressions of
Billingsgate, or Moorfields and Bartholomew Fair.
For I write not to such translators, but to men capacious
of the soul and genius of their authors,
without which all their labour will be of no use
but to disgrace themselves, and injure the author
that falls into their slaughter-house.</p>

<p>I believe I need give no other rules to the reader
than the following version, where example will be
stronger than precept, to which I now refer them;
in which a man justly qualified for a translator will
discover many rules extremely useful to that end.
But [to] a man who wants these natural qualifications
which are necessary for such an undertaking,
all particular precepts are of no other use, than to
make him a more remarkable coxcomb.

<h2>LETTERS OF DRYDEN.</h2>


<p>The Letters of Dryden, so far as hitherto given to the public,
are, with a few exceptions, singularly uninteresting. To the
publication of some, which are known to exist, there were found
to occur still stronger objections. I have been only able to add
one to those collected by Mr Malone; and I was strongly tempted
to omit several. There is, however, a satisfaction in seeing how
such a man expressed himself, even upon the most trivial occasions;
and I have therefore retained those complimentary acknowledgments
of turkeys, marrow-puddings, and bacon, which have nothing
but such a consideration to recommend them.

<p>If you have received the lines I sent by the reverend
Levite, I doubt not but they have exceedingly
wrought upon you; for beeing so longe in a
clergyman’s pocket, assuredly they have acquired
more sanctity than theire authour meant them.
Alasse, Madame! for ought I know, they may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
become a sermon ere they could arrive at you;
and believe it, haveing you for the text, it could
scarcely proove bad, if it light upon one that could
handle it indifferently. But I am so miserable a
preacher, that though I have so sweet and copious
a subject, I still fall short in my expressions; and,
instead of an use of thanksgiving, I am allways
makeing one of comfort, that I may one day againe
have the happinesse to kisse your faire hand; but
that is a message I would not so willingly do by
letter, as by word of mouth.</p>

<p>This is a point, I must confesse, I could willingly
dwell longer on; and, in this case, what ever I say
you may confidently take for gospell. But I must
hasten. And indeed, Madame, (<i>beloved</i> I had almost
sayd,) hee had need hasten who treats of you; for
to speake fully to every part of your excellencyes,
requires a longer houre than most persons<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> have
allotted them. But, in a word, your selfe hath
been the best expositor upon the text of your own
worth, in that admirable comment you wrote upon
it; I meane your incomparable letter. By all that’s
good, (and you, Madame, are a great part of my
oath,) it hath put mee so farre besides my selfe,
that I have scarce patience to write prose, and my
pen is stealing into verse every time I kisse your
letter. I am sure, the poor paper smarts for my
idolatry, which, by wearing it continually neere my
brest, will, at last, be burnt and martyrd in those
flames of adoration, which it hath kindled in mee.
But I forgett, Madame, what rarityes your letter
came fraught with, besides words. You are such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
deity that commands worship by provideing the sacrifice.
You are pleasd, Madame, to force me to
write, by sending me materialls, and compell me to
my greatest happinesse. Yet, though I highly value
your magnificent presente, pardon mee, if I
must tell the world, they are imperfect emblems of
your beauty; for the white and red of waxe and
paper are but shaddowes of that vermillion and
snow in your lips and forehead; and the silver of
the inkehorne, if it presume to vye whitenesse with
your purer skinne, must confesse it selfe blacker
then the liquor it containes. What then do I more

<h3>LETTER II.<br />

<span class="medium">TO [JOHN WILMOT,] EARL OF ROCHESTER.</span></h3>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">MY LORD,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">Tuesday. [July, 1673.]<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>
</p>

<p>I have accused my selfe this month together,
for not writing to you. I have called my selfe by
the names I deserved, of unmannerly and ungratefull.
I have been uneasy, and taken up the resolutions
of a man, who is betwixt sin and repentance,
convinc’d of what he ought to do, and yet
unable to do better. At the last, I deferred it so
long, that I almost grew hardened in the neglect;
and thought I had suffered so much in your good
opinion, that it was in vain to hope I could redeem
it. So dangerous a thing it is to be inclin’d to
sloath, that I must confess, once for all, I was
ready to quit all manner of obligations, and to receive,
as if it were my due, the most handsome
compliment, couch’d in the best language I have
read, and this too from my Lord of Rochester, without
shewing myself sensible of the favour. If your
Lordship could condescend so far to say all those
things to me, which I ought to have say’d to you,
it might reasonably be concluded, that you had enchanted
me to believe those praises, and that I owned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
them in my silence. ’Twas this consideration
that moved me at last to put off my idleness. And
now the shame of seeing my selfe overpay’d so
much for an ill Dedication, has made me almost repent
of my address. I find, it is not for me to
contend any way with your Lordship, who can
write better on the meanest subject, then I can on
the best. I have only engaged my selfe in a new
debt, when I had hoped to cancell a part of the old
one; and should either have chosen some other patron,
whom it was in my power to have obliged by
speaking better of him then he deserv’d, or have
made your Lordship only a hearty Dedication of the
respect and honour I had for you, without giving
you the occasion to conquer me, as you have done,
at my own weapon.</p>

<p>My only relief is, that what I have written is
publique, and I am so much my own friend as to
conceal your Lordship’s letter; for that which would
have given vanity to any other poet, has only given
me confusion.</p>

<p>You see, my Lord, how far you have push’d me;
I dare not own the honour you have done me, for
fear of shewing it to my own disadvantage. You
are that <i>rerum natura</i> of your own Lucretius;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri.</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>You are above any incense I can give you, and have
all the happiness of an idle life, join’d with the
good-nature of an active. Your friends in town are
ready to envy the leisure you have given your selfe
in the country, though they know you are only
their steward, and that you treasure up but so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
health as you intend to spend on them in winter.
In the mean time, you have withdrawn your selfe
from attendance, the curse of courts; you may
think on what you please, and that as little as you
please; for, in my opinion, thinking it selfe is a
kind of pain to a witty man; he finds so much
more in it to disquiet than to please him. But I
hope your Lordship will not omitt the occasion of
laughing at the great Duke of B[uckingham,] who
is so uneasy to him selfe by pursuing the honour of
lieutenant-general, which flyes him, that he can
enjoy nothing he possesses,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> though, at the same
time, he is so unfit to command an army, that he is
the only man in the three nations, who does not
know it; yet he still picques himself, like his father,
to find another Isle of Rhe in Zealand;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> thinking
this disappointment an injury to him, which is indeed
a favour, and will not be satisfied but with his
own ruin and with ours. ’Tis a strange quality in
a man to love idleness so well as to destroy his
estate by it; and yet, at the same time, to pursue
so violently the most toilsome and most unpleasant
part of business. These observations would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
soon run into lampoon, if I had not forsworn that
dangerous part of wit; not so much out of good-nature,
but lest from the inborn vanity of poets I
should shew it to others, and betray my selfe to a
worse mischief than what I do to my enemy. This
has been lately the case of Etherege, who, translating
a satyr of Boileau’s, and changing the French
names for English, read it so often, that it came to
their ears who were concern’d, and forced him to
leave off the design, e’re it were half finish’d. Two
of the verses I remember:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I call a spade, a spade; Eaton,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> a bully;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frampton,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> a pimp; and brother John, a cully.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But one of his friends imagin’d those names not
enough for the dignity of a satyr, and chang’d them
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I call a spade, a spade; Dunbar,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> a bully;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brounckard,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> a pimp; and Aubrey Vere,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> a cully.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Because I deal not in satyr, I have sent your
Lordship a prologue and epilogue, which I made for
our players, when they went down to Oxford. I
hear they have succeeded; and by the event your
Lordship will judge how easy ’tis to pass any thing
upon an university, and how gross flattery the
learned will endure.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> If your Lordship had been
in town, and I in the country, I durst not have entertained
you with three pages of a letter; but I
know they are very ill things which can be tedious
to a man, who is fourscore miles from Covent Garden.
’Tis upon this confidence, that I dare almost
promise to entertain you with a thousand <i>bagatelles</i>
every week, and not to be serious in any part of
my letter, but that wherein I take leave to call myself
your Lordship’s</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<p><i>The following Note and Letter contains the determination of
a dispute, and probably of a wager, which had been referred to our
author by the parties. It concerns a passage in Creech’s “Lucretius,”
and probably was written soon after the publication of that
translation in 1682, when it was a recent subject of conversation.
The full passage in “Lucretius” runs thus</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pr&aelig;terea qu&aelig;cunque vetustate amovet &aelig;tas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si penitus perimit, consumens materiam omnem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unde animale genus generatim in lumina vit&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redducit Venus?&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Which Creech thus renders</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Besides, if o’er whatever years prevail</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Should wholly perish, and its matter fail,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How could the powers of all kind Venus breed</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A constant race of animals to succeed?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>The translation of Creech is at least complicated and unintelligible;
and I am uncertain whether even Dryden’s explanation renders
it grammatical. Dryden speaks elsewhere with great applause
of Creech’s translation.</i></p>

<p><i>The original of this decision (in Dryden’s hand-writing) is in
the possession of Mrs White of Bownham-hall, Gloucestershire, and
was most obligingly communicated to the editor by that lady,
through the medium of Mr Constable of Edinburgh.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two verses, concerning which the dispute is
rais’d, are these:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Besides, if o’re whatever yeares prevaile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shou’d wholly perish, and its matter faile.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The question arising from them is, whether any
true grammatical construction can be made of them?
The objection is, that there is no nominative case
appearing to the word <i>perish</i>, or that can be understood
to belong to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>I have considered the verses, and find the authour
of them to have notoriously bungled; that
he has plac’d the words as confus’dly as if he had
studied to do so. This notwithstanding, the very
words, without adding or diminishing in theire proper
sence, (or at least what the authour meanes,) may
run thus:&mdash;<i>Besides, if what ever yeares prevaile over,
should wholly perish, and its matter faile.</i></p>

<p>I pronounce therefore, as impartially as I can
upon the whole, that there <i>is</i> a nominative case, and
that figurative, so as Terence and Virgil, amongst
others, use it; that is, the whole clause precedent is
the nominative case to <i>perish</i>. My reason is this,
and I think it obvious; let the question be ask’d,
what it is that should wholly perish, or that perishes?
The answer will be, That which yeares
prevaile over. If you will not admit a clause to
be in construction a nominative case, the word
<i>thing</i>, <i>illud</i>, or <i>quodcunque</i>, is to be understood, either
of which words, in the femine gender, agree
with <i>res</i>, so that he meanes what ever <i>thing</i> time
prevails over shou’d wholly perish, and its matter
faile.</p>

<p>Lucretius, his Latine runs thus:</p>

<p>The word, <i>perish</i>, used by Mr Creech, is a verb

active; a licence which, in translating a philosophical

<p>We have, with much ado, recover’d my younger

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
cold, and, as he thinks him selfe, a chine-cough.
The truth is, his constitution is very tender; yet
his desire of learning, I hope, will inable him to
brush through the college. He is allwayes gratefully
acknowledging your fatherly kindnesse to him;
and very willing to his poore power, to do all things
which may continue it. I have no more to add,
but only to wish the eldest may also deserve some
part of your good opinion; for I believe him to be
of vertuous and pious inclinations; and for both, I
dare assure you, that they can promise to them
selves no farther share of my indulgence, then
while they carry them selves with that reverence

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">SIR,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">[1682.]</span>
</p>

<p>If I could have found in my selfe a fitting temper
to have waited upon you, I had done it the day
you dismissed my sonn<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> from the college; for he
did the message: and by what I find from Mr Meredith,
as it was delivered by you to him; namely,
that you desired to see me, and had somewhat to
say to me concerning him. I observ’d likewise
somewhat of kindnesse in it, that you sent him
away, that you might not have occasion to correct
him. I examin’d the business, and found, it concern’d
his having been <i>custos</i><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> foure or five dayes
together. But if he admonished, and was not believed,
because other boyes combined to discredit
him with false witnesseing, and to save them selves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
perhaps his crime is not so great. Another fault, it
seems, he made, which was going into one Hawkes
his house, with some others; which you hapning
to see, sent your servant to know who they were,
and he onely returned you my sonn’s name; so the
rest escaped.</p>

<p>I have no fault to find with my sonn’s punishment;
for that is, and ought to be, reserv’d to any
master, much more to you, who have been his father’s.
But your man was certainly to blame to
name him onely; and ’tis onely my respect to you,
that I do not take notice of it to him. My first
rash resolutions were, to have brought things past
any composure, by immediately sending for my
sonn’s things out of college; but upon recollection,
I find, I have a double tye upon me not to do it:
one, my obligations to you for my education; another,
my great tendernesse of doeing any thing offensive
to my Lord Bishop of Rochester,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> as cheife
governour of the college. It does not consist with
the honour I beare him and you to go so precipitately
to worke; no, not so much as to have any
difference with you, if it can possibly be avoyded.
Yet, as my sonn stands now, I cannot see with
what credit he can be elected; for, being but sixth,
and (as you are pleased to judge,) not deserving that
neither, I know not whether he may not go immediately
to Cambridge, as well as one of his own
election went to Oxford this yeare<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> by your consent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
I will say nothing of my second sonn, but
that, after you had been pleased to advise me to
waite on my Lord Bishop for his favour, I found
he might have had the first place, if you had not
opposed it; and I likewise found at the election,
that, by the pains you had taken with him, he in
some sort deserved it.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, when you have given your selfe the
trouble to read thus farr, you, who are a prudent
man, will consider, that none complaine, but they
desire to be reconciled at the same time: there is
no mild expostulation, at least, which does not intimate
a kindness and respect in him who makes
it. Be pleas’d, if there be no merit on my side, to
make it your own act of grace to be what you were
formerly to my sonn. I have done something, so
far to conquer my own spirit as to ask it; and, indeed,
I know not with what face to go to my Lord
Bishop, and to tell him I am takeing away both my
sonns; for though I shall tell him no occasion, it
will looke like a disrespect to my old master, of
which I will not be guilty, if it be possible. I shall
add no more, but hope I shall be so satisfyed with
a favourable answer from you, which I promise to
my selfe from your goodnesse and moderation, that
I shall still have occasion to continue,</p>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">MY LORD,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">[Perhaps August 1683.]</span>
</p>

<p>I know not whether my Lord Sunderland has
interceded with your Lordship for half a yeare of
my salary; but I have two other advocates, my extreme
wants, even almost to arresting, and my ill
health, which cannot be repaired without immediate
retireing into the country. A quarter’s allowance
is but the Jesuit’s powder to my disease; the
fit will return a fortnight hence. If I durst, I would
plead a little merit, and some hazards of my life from
the common enemyes; my refuseing advantages
offered by them, and neglecting my beneficiall tudyes,
for the King’s service: but I only thinke I
merit not to sterve. I never apply’d myselfe to any
interest contrary to your Lordship’s; and on some
occasions, perhaps not known to you, have not
been unserviceable to the memory and reputation
of my Lord, your father.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> After this, my Lord, my
conscience assures me, I may write boldly, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
I cannot speake to you. I have three sonns growing
to man’s estate; I breed them all up to learning,
beyond my fortune; but they are too hopefull
to be neglected, though I want. Be pleased to
looke on me with an eye of compassion. Some
small employment would render my condition easy.
The King is not unsatisfied of me; the Duke has
often promised me his assistance; and your Lordship
is the conduit through which they passe, either
in the Customes, or the Appeals of the Excise,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
or some other way, meanes cannot be wanting, if
you please to have the will. ’Tis enough for one
age to have neglected Mr Cowley, and sterv’d Mr
Butler; but neither of them had the happiness to
live till your Lordship’s ministry. In the meane
time, be pleased to give me a gracious and speedy
answer to my present request of halfe a yeare’s pention
for my necessityes. I am going to write somewhat
by his Majesty’s command,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and cannot stir
into the country for my health and studies, till I
secure my family from want. You have many petitions
of this nature, and cannot satisfy all; but I
hope, from your goodness, to be made an exception
to your general rules,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> because I am, with all sincerity,</p>

<span class="tcell i2">MR TONSON,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">Monday Morning, [1684.]</span>
</p>

<p>The two melons you sent I received before your
letter, which came foure houres after: I tasted one
of them, which was too good to need an excuse;
the other is yet untouched. You have written
diverse things which give me great satisfaction;
particularly that the History of the League is commended:
and I hope the onely thing I feared in it
is not found out.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Take it all together, and I dare
say without vanity, ’tis the best translation of any
history in English, though I cannot say ’tis the best
history; but that is no fault of mine. I am glad
my Lord Duke of Ormond has one: I did not forget
him; but I thought his sorrows were too fresh
upon him to receive a present of that nature.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> For
my Lord Roscommon’s Essay,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> I am of your opinion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
that you should reprint it, and that you may
safely venture on a thousand more. In my verses
before it, pray let the printer mend his errour, and
let the line stand thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That heer his conqu’ring ancestors were nurs’d;&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Charles his copy<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> is all true. The other faults my
Lord Roscommon will mend in the booke, or Mr
Chetwood<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> for him, if my Lord be gone for Ireland;
of which, pray send me word.</p>

<p>Your opinion of the Miscellanyes<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> is likewise
mine: I will for once lay by the “<i>Religio Laici</i>,”
till another time. But I must also add, that since
we are to have nothing but new, I am resolved we
will have nothing but good, whomever we disoblige.
You will have of mine, four Odes of Horace, which
I have already translated; another small translation
of forty lines from Lucretius; the whole story of
Nisus and Eurialus, both in the fifth and the ninth
of Virgil’s &AElig;neids: and I care not who translates
them beside me; for let him be friend or foe, I will
please myself, and not give off in consideration of
any man. There will be forty lines more of Virgil
in another place, to answer those of Lucretius: I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
meane those very lines which Montagne has compared
in those two poets; and Homer shall sleep
on for me,&mdash;I will not now meddle with him. And
for the Act which remains of the Opera,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> I believe
I shall have no leysure to mind it, after I have done
what I proposed; for my business here is to unweary
my selfe after my studyes, not to drudge.</p>

<p>I am very glad you have pay’d Mr Jones, because
he has carryed him selfe so gentlemanlike to
me; and, if ever it lyes in my power, I will requite
it. I desire to know whether the Duke’s House are
makeing cloaths, and putting things in a readiness
for the singing Opera, to be played immediately
after Michaelmasse.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> For the actors in the two
playes<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> which are to be acted of mine this winter,
I had spoken with Mr Betterton by chance at the
Coffee-house the afternoon before I came away;
and I believe that the persons were all agreed on,
to be just the same you mentioned; only Octavia
was to be Mrs Butler, in case Mrs Cooke were not
on the stage; and I know not whether Mrs Percival,
who is a comedian, will do well for Benzayda.</p>

<p>I came hither for health, and had a kind of hectique
feavour for a fortnight of the time: I am now
much better. Poore Jack<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> is not yet recovered of
an intermitting feavour, of which this is the twelfth
day; but he mends, and now begins to eat flesh:
to add to this, my man, with over care of him, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
fallen ill too, of the same distemper; so that I am
deep in doctors, ’pothecaries, and nurses: but though
many in this country fall sick of feavours, few or
none dye. Your friend, Charles,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> continues well.
If you have any extraordinary newes, I should be
glad to heare it. I will answer Mr Butler’s letter
next week; for it requires no hast.</p>

<h3>LETTER VIII.<br />

<span class="medium">FROM JACOB TONSON TO JOHN DRYDEN, ESQ.</span></h3>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">SIR,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">[Probably written in Jan. or Feb. 1692-3.]<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span>
</p>

<p>I have here returned y<sup>e</sup> Ovid, w<sup>ch</sup> I read w<sup>t</sup>h a
great deal of pleasure, and think nothing can be
more entertaining; but by this letter you find I am
not soe well satisfied as perhaps you might think.
I hope at y<sup>e</sup> same time the matter of fact I lay down
in this letter will appear grounds for it, and w<sup>ch</sup> I
beg you wou’d concider of; and then I believe I
shall at least bee excused.</p>

<p>You may please, S<sup>r</sup>, to remember, that upon my
first proposal about y<sup>e</sup> 3<sup>d</sup> Miscellany, I offer’d fifty
pounds, and talk’d of several authours, without
naming Ovid. You ask’d if it shou’d not be guynneas,
and said I shou’d not repent it; upon w<sup>ch</sup> I
imediately comply’d, and left it wholy to you what,
and for y<sup>e</sup> quantity too: and I declare it was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
farthest in y<sup>e</sup> world from my thoughts that by leaving
it to you I shou’d have the less. Thus the case
stood when you went into Essex. After I came
out of Northamptonshire I wrote to you, and reseived
a letter dated Monday Oct. 3<sup>d</sup>, 92, from w<sup>ch</sup>
letter I now write word for word what followes:</p>

<p>“I am translating about six hundred lines, or
somewhat less, of y<sup>e</sup> first book of the Metamorphoses.
If I cannot get my price, w<sup>ch</sup> shall be
twenty guynneas, I will translate the whole book;
w<sup>ch</sup> coming out before the whole translation, will
spoyl Tate’s undertakings. ’Tis one of the best I
have ever made, and very pleasant. This, w<sup>th</sup> Heroe
and Leander, and the piece of Homer, (or, if it
be not enough, I will add more,) will make a good
part of a Miscellany.”</p>

<p>Those, S<sup>r</sup>, are y<sup>e</sup> very words, and y<sup>e</sup> onely ones
in that letter relating to that affair; and y<sup>e</sup> Monday
following you came to town.&mdash;After your arrivall
you shew’d Mr Motteaux what you had done, (w<sup>ch</sup>
he told me was to y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> story of Daphnis,)
[Daphne,] and demanded, as you mention’d in your
letter, twenty guyneas, w<sup>ch</sup> that bookseller refus’d.
Now, S<sup>r</sup>, I the rather believe there was just soe
much done, by reason y<sup>e</sup> number of lines you mention
in yo<sup>r</sup> letter agrees w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> quantity of lines that
soe much of y<sup>e</sup> first book makes; w<sup>ch</sup> upon counting
y<sup>e</sup> Ovid, I find to be in y<sup>e</sup> Lattin 566, in y<sup>e</sup> English
759; and y<sup>e</sup> bookseller told me there was noe
more demanded of him for it.&mdash;Now, S<sup>r</sup>, what I
entreat you wou’d please to consider of is this: that
it is reasonable for me to expect at least as much
favour from you as a strange bookseller; and I will
never believe y<sup>t</sup> it can be in yo<sup>r</sup> nature to use one
y<sup>e</sup> worse for leaveing it to you; and if the matter of
fact as I state it be true, (and upon my word what
I mention I can shew you in yo<sup>r</sup> letter,) then pray,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
S<sup>r</sup>, consider how much dearer I pay then you offered
it to y<sup>e</sup> other bookseller; for he might have
had to y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> story of Daphnis for 20 guynneas,
<span class="trow tdr">w<sup>ch</sup> is in yo<sup>r</sup> translation
 ... 759 lines;</span>
<span class="trow">And then suppose 20 guyneas more for the same number ... 759 lines,</span>
<span class="trow tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</span>
<span class="trow tdr">that makes for 40 guyneas                            1518 lines;</span>
and all that I have for fifty guyneas are but 1446;
soe that, if I have noe more, I pay 10 guyneas above
40, and have 72 lines less for fifty, in proportion,
than the other bookseller shou’d have had for 40, at
y<sup>e</sup> rate you offered him y<sup>e</sup> first part. This is, Sir,
what I shall take as a great favour if you please to
think of. I had intentions of letting you know
this before; but till I had paid y<sup>e</sup> money, I would
not ask to see the book, nor count the lines, least it
shou’d look like a design of not keeping my word.
When you have looked over y<sup>e</sup> rest of what you
have already translated, I desire you would send it;
and I own y<sup>t</sup> if you don’t think fit to add something
more, I must submit: ’tis wholly at yo<sup>r</sup> choice, for
I left it intirely to you; but I believe you cannot
imagine I expected soe little; for you were pleased
to use me much kindlyer in Juvenall, w<sup>ch</sup> is not
reckon’d soe easy to translate as Ovid. S<sup>r</sup>, I humbly
beg yo<sup>r</sup> pardon for this long letter, and upon
my word I had rather have yo<sup>r</sup> good will than any
man’s alive; and, whatever you are pleased to doe,
will alway acknowledge my self, S<sup>r</sup>,</p>

<p>I am much asham’d of my self, that I am so

all things I am sensible of your good nature, in
bearing me company to this place, wherein, besides
the cost, you must needs neglect your own business;
but I will endeavour to make you some amends;
and therefore I desire you to command me something
for your service. I am sure you thought my
Lord Radclyffe<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> wou’d have done something: I
ghess’d more truly, that he cou’d not; but I was too
far ingag’d to desist, though I was tempted to it by
the melancholique prospect I had of it. I have
translated six hundred lines of Ovid; but I believe
I shall not compasse his 772 lines under nine
hundred or more of mine.&mdash;This time I cannot
write to my wife, because he who is to carry my
letter to Oundle, will not stay till I can write another.
Pray, Sir, let her know that I am well;
and for feare the few damsins shou’d be all gone,
desire her to buy me a sieve-full, to preserve whole,
and not in mash.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

suspect a wooeing, and his caleche is gone with
him: so that I have been but thrice at Tichmarsh,
of which you were with me once. This disappointment
makes the place wearysome to me, which
otherwise wou’d be pleasant.</p>

<p>About a fortnight ago I had an intimation from
a friend by letter, that one of the secretaryes, I

I had abus’d her government (those were the words)
in my Epistle to my Lord Radcliffe; and that thereupon
she had commanded her historiographer, Rymer,
to fall upon my playes; which he assures me
is now doeing. I doubt not his malice, from a
former hint you gave me; and if he be employ’d, I
am confident ’tis of his own seeking; who, you
know, has spoken slightly of me in his last critique:<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>

<h3>LETTER X.<br />

<span class="medium">MR JOHN DENNIS<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> TO MR DRYDEN.</span></h3>

<p class="i4">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>You may see already by this presumptuous greeting,
that encouragement gives as much assurance
to friendship, as it imparts to love. You may see
too, that a friend may sometimes proceed to acknowledge
affection, by the very same degrees by
which a lover declares his passion. This last at
first confesses esteem, yet owns no passion but admiration.
But as soon as he is animated by one
kind expression, his look, his style, and his very
soul are altered. But as sovereign beauties know
very well, that he who confesses he esteems and
admires them, implies that he loves them, or is inclined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
to love them: a person of Mr Dryden’s exalted
genius, can discern very well, that when we
esteem him highly, ’tis respect restrains us, if we
say no more. For where great esteem is without
affection, ’tis often attended with envy, if not with
hate; which passions detract even when they commend,
and silence is their highest panegyrick.
’Tis indeed impossible, that I should refuse to love
a man, who has so often given me all the pleasure
that the most insatiable mind can desire: when at
any time I have been dejected by disappointments,
or tormented by cruel passions, the recourse to your
verses has calm’d my soul, or raised it to transports
which made it contemn tranquillity. But though
you have so often given me all the pleasure I was
able to bear, I have reason to complain of you on
this account, that you have confined my delight
to a narrower compass. Suckling, Cowley, and
Denham, who formerly ravished me in every part
of them, now appear tasteless to me in most; and
Waller himself, with all his gallantry, and all that
admirable art of his turns, appears three quarters
prose to me. Thus ’tis plain, that your Muse has
done me an injury; but she has made me amends
for it. For she is like those extraordinary women,
who, besides the regularity of their charming
features, besides their engaging wit, have secret,
unaccountable, enchanting graces; which though
they have been long and often enjoyed, make them
always new and always desirable.&mdash;I return you
my hearty thanks for your most obliging letter. I
had been very unreasonable, if I had repined that
the favour arrived no sooner. ’Tis allowable to
grumble at the delaying a payment; but to murmur
at the deferring a benefit, is to be impudently
ungrateful beforehand. The commendations which
you give me, exceedingly sooth my vanity. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
you with a breath can bestow or confirm reputation;
a whole numberless people proclaims the praise which
you give, and the judgments of three mighty kingdoms
appear to depend upon yours. The people
gave me some little applause before; but to whom,
when they are in the humour, will they not give it?
and to whom, when they are froward, will they not
refuse it? Reputation with them depends upon
chance, unless they are guided by those above
them. They are but the keepers, as it were, of
the lottery which Fortune sets up for renown;
upon which Fame is bound to attend with her
trumpet, and sound when men draw the prizes.
Thus I had rather have your approbation than the
applause of Fame. Her commendation argues good
luck, but Mr Dryden’s implies desert. Whatever
low opinion I have hitherto had of myself, I have
so great a value for your judgment, that, for the
sake of that, I shall be willing henceforward to believe
that I am not wholly desertless; but that you
may find me still more supportable, I shall endeavour
to compensate whatever I want in those
glittering qualities, by which the world is dazzled,
with truth, with faith, and with zeal to
serve you; qualities which for their rarity, might
be objects of wonder, but that men dare not appear
to admire them, because their admiration would
manifestly declare their want of them. Thus, Sir,
let me assure you, that though you are acquainted
with several gentlemen, whose eloquence and wit
may capacitate them to offer their service with
more address to you, yet no one can declare himself,
with greater chearfulness, or with greater fidelity,
or with more profound respect than myself,</p>

<h3>LETTER XI.<br />

<span class="medium">TO MR JOHN DENNIS. [In answer to the foregoing.]</span></h3>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">MY DEAR MR DENNIS,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">[Probably March 1693-4.]</span>
</p>

<p>When I read a letter so full of my commendations
as your last, I cannot but consider you
as the master of a vast treasure, who having more
than enough for yourself, are forced to ebb out
upon your friends. You have indeed the best right
to give them, since you have them in propriety;
but they are no more mine when I receive them
than the light of the moon can be allowed to
be her own, who shines but by the reflexion of
her brother. Your own poetry is a more powerful
example, to prove that the modern writers may
enter into comparison with the ancients, than any
which Perrault could produce in France: yet neither
he, nor you, who are a better critick, can persuade
me, that there is any room left for a solid
commendation at this time of day, at least for me.</p>

<p>If I undertake the translation of Virgil, the little
which I can perform will shew at least, that no
man is fit to write after him, in a barbarous modern
tongue. Neither will his machines be of any
service to a Christian poet. We see how ineffectually
they have been tryed by Tasso, and by
Ariosto. It is using them too dully, if we only
make devils of his gods: as if, for example, I would
raise a storm, and make use of &AElig;olus, with this
only difference of calling him Prince of the Air;
what invention of mine would there be in this? or
who would not see Virgil thorough me; only the
same trick played over again by a bungling juggler?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Boileau has well observed, that it is an easy
matter in a Christian poem, for God to bring the
Devil to reason. I think I have given a better
hint for new machines in my preface to Juvenal;
where I have particularly recommended two subjects,
one of King Arthur’s conquest of the Saxons,
and the other of the Black Prince in his conquest of
Spain. But the guardian angels of monarchys and
kingdoms are not to be touched by every hand: a
man must be deeply conversant in the Platonic philosophy,
to deal with them; and therefore I may
reasonably expect, that no poet of our age will presume
to handle those machines, for fear of discovering
his own ignorance; or if he should, he might
perhaps be ingrateful enough not to own me for his
benefactour.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>After I have confessed thus much of our modern
heroic poetry, I cannot but conclude with Mr
Rymer, that our English comedy is far beyond any
thing of the ancients: and notwithstanding our
irregularities, so is our tragedy. Shakspeare had
a genius for it; and we know, in spite of Mr
Rymer, that genius alone is a greater virtue (if I
may so call it) than all other qualifications put together.
You see what success this learned critick
has found in the world, after his blaspheming
Shakspeare.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Almost all the faults which he has
discovered are truly there; yet who will read Mr
Rymer, or not read Shakspeare? For my own part
I reverence Mr Rymer’s learning, but I detest his
ill-nature and his arrogance. I indeed, and such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
I, have reason to be afraid of him, but Shakspeare
has not.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>There is another part of poetry, in which the
English stand almost upon an equal foot with the
ancients; and it is that which we call Pindarique;
introduced, but not perfected, by our famous Mr
Cowley: and of this, Sir, you are certainly one of
the greatest masters. You have the sublimity of
sense as well as sound, and know how far the boldness
of a poet may lawfully extend. I could wish
you would cultivate this kind of Ode; and reduce
it either to the same measures which Pindar used,
or give new measures of your own. For, as it is, it
looks like a vast tract of land newly discovered:
the soil is wonderfully fruitful, but unmanured;
overstocked with inhabitants, but almost all savages,
without laws, arts, arms, or policy.</p>

<p>I remember, poor Nat. Lee, who was then upon
the verge of madness, yet made a sober and a witty
answer to a bad poet, who told him, “It was an
easie thing to write like a madman:” “No,” said
he, “it is very difficult to write like a madman, but
it is a very easie matter to write like a fool.”
Otway and he are safe by death from all attacks,
but we poor poets militant (to use Mr Cowley’s
expression) are at the mercy of wretched scribblers:
and when they cannot fasten upon our verses, they
fall upon our morals, our principles of state, and religion.
For my principles of religion, I will not
justifie them to you: I know yours are far different.
For the same reason, I shall say nothing of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
principles of state. I believe you and yours follow
the dictates of your reason, as I in mine do those of
my conscience. If I thought myself in an errour,
I would retract it. I am sure that I suffer for
them; and Milton makes even the Devil say, that
no creature is in love with pain. For my morals
betwixt man and man, I am not to be my own
judge. I appeal to the world, if I have deceived or
defrauded any man: and for my private conversation,
they who see me every day can be the best
witnesses, whether or no it be blameless and inoffensive.
Hitherto I have no reason to complain that
men of either party shun my company. I have never
been an impudent beggar at the doors of noblemen:
my visits have indeed been too rare to be
unacceptable; and but just enough to testifie my
gratitude for their bounty, which I have frequently
received, but always unasked, as themselves will
witness.</p>

<p>I have written more than I needed to you on this
subject; for I dare say you justifie me to yourself.
As for that which I first intended for the principal
subject of this letter, which is my friend’s passion
and his design of marriage, on better consideration
I have changed my mind; for having had the honour
to see my dear friend Wycherly’s letter to him
on that occasion, I find nothing to be added or
amended. But as well as I love Mr Wycherly, I
confess I love myself so well, that I will not shew
how much I am inferiour to him in wit and judgment,
by undertaking any thing after him. There
is Moses and the Prophets in his council. Jupiter
and Juno, as the poets tell us, made Tiresias their
umpire in a certain merry dispute, which fell out in
heaven betwixt them. Tiresias, you know, had
been of both sexes, and therefore was a proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
judge; our friend Mr Wycherly is full as competent
an arbitrator; he has been a bachelor, and
marryed man, and is now a widower. Virgil says
of Ceneus,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Nunc vir, nunc fœmina, Ceneus,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rursus et in veterem fato revoluta figuram.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Yet I suppose he will not give any large commendations
to his middle state: nor, as the sailer said,
will be fond after a shipwrack to put to sea again.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
If my friend will adventure after this, I can but
wish him a good wind, as being his, and,</p>

<h3>LETTER XII.<br />

<span class="medium">TO MR JACOB TONSON.</span></h3>

<p><i>The copy money for translating the &AElig;neid was fifty pounds for
each Book. The rising of the second subscription seems, to allude
to the practice of fixing a day, after which no subscriptions
were to be received except on payment of an advanced price.
The first subscribers to Dryden’s Virgil paid five guineas; a plate
was dedicated to each of them, and ornamented with his arms. A
second class paid two guineas only, and were not so honoured. In
the subsequent letters there occur several allusions to these arrangements,
and to the transference of names from the higher to the lower
class.</i></p>

</p>

<p>It is now three dayes since I have ended the
fourth Eneid; and I am this morning beginning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
transcribe it, as you may do afterwards; for I am
willing some few of my friends may see it, and
shall give leave to you, to shew your transcription
to some others, whose names I will tell you. The
paying Ned Sheldon the fifty pounds put me upon
this speed; but I intend not so much to overtoil
myself, after the sixth book is ended. If the second
subscriptions rise, I will take so much the more time,
because the profit will incourage me the more; if
not, I must make the more haste; yet always with
as much care as I am able. But however, I will
not fail in my paines of translating the sixth Eneid
with the same exactness as I have performed the
fourth: because that book is my greatest favourite.
You know money is now very scrupulously receiv’d:
in the last which you did me the favour to change
for my wife, besides the clip’d money, there were
at least forty shillings brass. You may, if you please,
come to me at the Coffee-house this afternoon, or
at farthest to-morrow, that we may take care together,
where and when I may receive the fifty
pounds and the guinneys; which must be some
time this week.</p>

it wou’d grieve me if you should loose, by your too

to take gold,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> neither will I; nor stay for it beyond
four-and-twenty houres after it is due. I thank
you for the civility of your last letter in the country;
but the thirty shillings upon every book remains
with me. You always intended I should
get nothing by the second subscriptions, as I found
from first to last. And your promise to Mr Congreve,
that you had found a way for my benefit,
which was an encouragement to my paines, came
at last, for me to desire Sir Godfrey Kneller and
Mr Closterman to gather for me. I then told
Mr Congreve, that I knew you too well to believe
you meant me any kindness: and he promised me
to believe accordingly of you, if you did not. But
this is past; and you shall have your bargain, if I
live and have my health. You may send me word
what you have done in my business with the Earl
of Derby: and I must have a place for the Duke
of Devonshyre. Some of your friends will be glad

of Macclesfield gave her money to Will Plowden

</p>

<p>I receiv’d your letter very kindly,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> because indeed
I expected none; but thought you as very
a tradesman as Bentley,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> who has cursed our Virgil
so heartily. I shall loose enough by your bill
upon Mr Knight;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> for after having taking it all in
silver, and not in half-crowns neither, but shillings
and sixpences, none of the money will go; for
which reason I have sent it all back again, and as
the less loss will receive it in guinneys at 29 shillings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
each. ’Tis troublesome to be a looser, but it
was my own fault to accept it this way, which I
did to avoyd more trouble.</p>

<p>I am not sorry that you will not allow any thing
towards the notes; for to make them good, would
have cost me half a yeare’s time at least. Those I
write shall be only marginall, to help the unlearned,
who understand not the poeticall fables. The
prefaces, as I intend them, will be somewhat more
learned. It wou’d require seaven yeares to translate
Virgil exactly. But I promise you once more
to do my best in the four remaining books, as I
have hitherto done in the foregoing.&mdash;Upon triall
I find all of your trade are sharpers, and you not
more than others; therefore I have not wholly left
you. Mr Aston does not blame you for getting as
good a bargain as you cou’d, though I cou’d have
gott an hundred pounds more; and you might
have spared almost all your trouble if you had
thought fit to publish the proposalls for the first
subscriptions; for I have guynneas offered me every
day, if there had been room; I believe, modestly
speaking, I have refused already 25. I mislike
nothing in your letter therefore, but onely your
upbraiding me with the publique encouragement,
and my own reputation concerned in the notes;
when I assure you I cou’d not make them to my
mind in less than half a year’s time. Get the first
half of Virgil transcribed as soon as possibly you
can, that I may put the notes to it; and you may
have the other four books which lye ready for you
when you bring the former; that the press may
stay as little as possibly it can. My Lord Chesterfield
has been to visite me, but I durst say nothing
of Virgil to him, for feare there should be no void
place for him; if there be, let me know; and tell me
whether you have made room for the Duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
as you offer’d, that it should be transcrib’d in a legible

are not every where, and when they are, are imperfect;
so that you ought not to transcribe them, till
I make them compleat. I feare you can scarcely
make any thing of my foul copy; but it is the best
I have. You see, my hand fails me, and therefore
I write so short a letter. What I wrote yesterday
was too sharp; but I doubt it is all true. Your

<p>I cannot yet find the first sheet of the first Eneid.

<h3>LETTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="medium">TO HIS SONS AT ROME.</span></h3>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell i2">DEAR SONS,</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">Sept. the 3d. our Style, [1697.]</span>
</p>

<p>Being now at Sir William Bowyer’s,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> in the country,
I cannot write at large, because I find my self
somewhat indisposed with a cold, and am thick of
hearing, rather worse than I was in town. I am
glad to find, by your letter of July 26th, your style,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
that you are both in health; but wonder you should
think me so negligent as to forget to give you an
account of the ship in which your parcel is to come.
I have written to you two or three letters concerning
it, which I have sent by safe hands, as I told
you; and doubt not but you have them before this
can arrive to you. Being out of town, I have forgotten
the ship’s name, which your mother will enquire,
and put it into her letter, which is joined
with mine. But the master’s name I remember;
he is called Mr Ralph Thorp; the ship is bound to
Leghorn, consigned to Mr Peter and Mr Tho. Ball,
merchants. I am of your opinion, that, by Tonson’s
means, almost all our letters have miscarried
for this last year.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> But, however, he has missed of
his design in the dedication, though he had prepared
the book for it;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> for, in every figure of &AElig;neas,
he has caused him to be drawn like King William,
with a hooked nose.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>After my return to town, I intend to alter a play
of Sir Robert Howard’s, written long since, and
lately put by him into my hands: ’tis called the
“Conquest of China by the Tartars.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> It will cost
me six weeks study, with the probable benefit of
an hundred pounds. In the mean time, I am
writing a song for St Cecilia’s Feast, who, you
know, is the patroness of music. This is troublesome,
and no way beneficial; but I could not deny
the stewards of the feast, who came in a body to
me to desire that kindness, one of them being Mr
Bridgman, whose parents are your mother’s friends.
I hope to send you thirty guineas between Michaelmass
and Christmass, of which I will give you an
account when I come to town. I remember the
counsel you give me in your letter; but dissembling,
though lawful in some cases, is not my talent;
yet, for your sake, I will struggle with the
plain openness of my nature, and keep in my just
resentments against that degenerate order.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> In the
mean time, I flatter not myself with any manner of
hopes, but do my duty, and suffer for God’s sake;
being assured, beforehand, never to be rewarded,
though the times should alter. Towards the latter
end of this month, September, Charles will begin
to recover his perfect health, according to his nativity,
which, casting it my self, I am sure is true;
and all things hitherto have happened accordingly
to the very time that I predicted them. I hope, at
the same time, to recover more health, according
to my age. Remember me to poor Harry, whose
prayers I earnestly desire. My Virgil succeeds in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the world beyond its desert, or my expectation.
You know, the profits might have been more; but
neither my conscience nor my honour would suffer
me to take them;<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> but I never can repent of my
constancy, since I am thoroughly persuaded of the
justice of the cause for which I suffer. It has pleased
God to raise up many friends to me amongst
my enemies, though they, who ought to have been
my friends, are negligent of me. I am called to
dinner, and cannot go on with this letter, which I
desire you to excuse; and am</p>

twice there, for <i>Thais</i>; those two ladyes were contemporaryes,
which causd that small mistake. I

<p>You were no sooner gone, but I felt in my
pocket, and found my Lady Chudleigh’s<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> verses;
which this afternoon I gave Mr Walsh to read in
the coffee-house. His opinion is the same with
mine, that they are better than any which are
printed before the book: so thinks also Mr Wycherly.
I have them by me; but do not send them
till I heare from my Lord Clifford, whether my lady
will put her name to them or not: therefore I
desire they may be printed last of all the copyes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
and of all the book. I have also written this day
to Mr Chetwood, and let him know, that the book
is immediately goeing to the press again. My opinion
is, that the printer shou’d begin with the first
Pastoral, and print on to the end of the Georgiques;
or farther, if occasion be, till Dr Chetwood corrects
his preface,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> which he writes me word is printed
very false. You cannot take too great care of
the printing this edition exactly after my amendments;
for a fault of that nature will disoblige me
eternally.</p>

<p>I am glad to heare from all hands, that my Ode<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
is esteem’d the best of all my poetry, by all the
town: I thought so myself when I writ it; but,
being old, I mistrusted my own judgment. I hope
it has done you service, and will do more. You
told me not, but the town says you are printing
Ovid <i>de Arte Amandi</i>. I know my translation<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> is
very uncorrect; but at the same time I know, nobody
else can do it better, with all their paines. If
there be any loose papers left in the Virgil I gave
you this morning, look for them, and send them
back by my man: I miss not any yet; but ’tis possible
some may be left, because I gave you the book
in a hurry. I vow to God, if Everingham takes
not care of this impression, he shall never print any
thing of mine heerafter: for I will write on, since
I find I can.</p>

<p>I desire you to make sure of the three pounds of
snuff, the same of which I had one pound from you.
When you send it any morning, I will pay for it all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
together. But this is not the business of this
letter.&mdash;When you were heer, I intended to have sent
an answer to poor Charles his letter; but I had not
then the letter which my chirurgeon promis’d me,
of his advice, to prevent a rupture, which he fears.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
Now I have the surgeon’s answer, which I have inclosed
in my letter to my sonn. This is a business
of the greatest consequence in the world; for you
know how I love Charles: and therefore I write to
you with all the earnestness of a father, that you
will procure Mr Francia<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> to inclose it in his packet
this week: for a week lost may be my sonn’s
ruine; whom I intend to send for next summer,
without his brother, as I have written him word:
and if it please God that I must dye of over-study,
I cannot spend my life better, than in saving his. I
vallue not any price for a double letter; let me
know it, and it shall be payd; for I dare not trust
it by the post: being satisfy’d by experience, that
Ferrand will do by this, as he did by two letters
which I sent my sonns, about my dedicating to the
king;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> of which they received neither. If you
cannot go yourself, then send a note to Signior

<p>To take acknowledgments of favours for favours
done you, is onely yours. I am always on the receiving
hand; and you, who have been pleas’d to
be troubled so long with my bad company, in stead
of forgiveing, which is all I could expect, will turn
it to a kindness on my side. If your house be often
so molested, you will have reason to be weary
of it, before the ending of the year: and wish Cotterstock
were planted in a desart, an hundred miles
off from any poet.&mdash;After I had lost the happiness
of your company, I could expect no other than the
loss of my health, which followed, according to the
proverb, that misfortunes seldome come alone. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
had no woman to visite<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> but the parson’s wife;
and she, who was intended by nature as a help
meet for a deaf husband, was somewhat of the loudest
for my conversation; and for other things, I
will say no more then that she is just your contrary,
and an epitome of her own country. My journey
to London was yet more unpleasant than my
abode at Tichmarsh; for the coach was crowded
up with an old woman fatter than any of my hostesses
on the rode. Her weight made the horses
travel very heavily; but, to give them a breathing
time, she would often stop us, and plead some necessity
of nature, and tell us, we were all flesh and
blood: but she did this so frequently, that at last
we conspir’d against her; and that she might not
be inconvenienc’d by staying in the coach, turn’d
her out in a very dirty place, where she was to
wade up to the ankles, before she cou’d reach the
next hedge. When I was ridd of her, I came sick
home, and kept my house for three weeks together;
but, by advice of my doctour, takeing twice the
bitter draught, with sena in it, and looseing at least
twelve ounces of blood, by cupping on my neck, I
am just well enough to go abroad in the afternoon;
but am much afflicted that I have you a companion
of my sickness: though I ’scap’d with one cold fit
of an ague, and yours, I feare, is an intermitting
feavour. Since I heard nothing of your father, whom
I left ill, I hope he is recover’d of his reall sickness,
and that your sister is well of hers, which was onely
in imagination. My wife and sonn return you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>

<p>All my letters being nothing but acknowledgements
of your favours to me, ’tis no wonder if they
are all alike: for they can but express the same
thing, I being eternally the receiver, and you the
giver. I wish it were in my power to turn the
skale on the other hand, that I might see how you,
who have so excellent a wit, cou’d thank on your
side. Not to name my self or my wife, my sonn
Charles is the great commender of your last receiv’d
present; who being of late somewhat indispos’d,
uses to send for some of the same sort, which
we call heer marrow-puddings, for his suppers; but
the tast of yours has so spoyl’d his markets heer,
that there is not the least comparison betwixt them.
You are not of an age to be a Sybill, and yet I
think you are a prophetess; for the direction on
your basket was for him; and he is likely to enjoy
the greatest part of them: for I always think the
young are more worthy than the old; especially
since you are one of the former sort, and that he
mends upon your medicine.&mdash;I am very glad to
hear my cousin, your father, is comeing or come to

him as it has been to me: but you tell me nothing

agueish for this season.&mdash;My wife and sonn give
you their most humble thanks and service; as I do
mine to my cousin Steward; and am, Madam,</p>

<p>Old men are not so insensible of beauty, as it
may be, you young ladies think. For my own part,
I must needs acknowledge, that your fair eyes had
made me your slave before I received your fine presents.
Your letter puts me out of doubt that they
have lost nothing of their luster, because it was
written with your own hand; and not heareing of
a feavour or an ague, I will please my self with the
thoughts that they have wholly left you. I wou’d
also flatter my self with the hopes of waiting on
you at Cotterstock some time next summer; but
my want of health may perhaps hinder me. But if
I am well enough to travell as farr northward as
Northamptonshyre, you are sure of a guest, who
has been too well us’d not to trouble you again.</p>

<p>My sonn, of whom you have done me the favour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
to enquire, mends of his indisposition very slowly;
the ayr of England not agreeing with him hetherto
so well as that of Italy. The Bath is propos’d
by the doctors, both to him and me: but we have
not yet resolved absolutely on that journey; for that
city is so close and so ill situated, that perhaps the
ayr may do us more harm than the waters can do
us good: for which reason we intend to try them
heer first; and if we find not the good effect
which is promis’d of them, we will save our selves
the pains of goeing thether. In the mean time, betwixt
my intervals of physique, and other remedies
which I am using for my gravel, I am still
drudgeing on: always a poet, and never a good
one. I pass my time sometimes with Ovid, and
sometimes with our old English poet Chaucer;
translating such stories as best please my fancy;
and intend, besides them, to add somewhat of my
own; so that it is not impossible, but ere the summer
be pass’d, I may come down to you with a volume
in my hand, like a dog out of the water, with
a duck in his mouth. As for the rarities you promise,
if beggars might be choosers, a part of a chine
of honest bacon wou’d please my appetite more
than all the marrow puddings; for I like them better
plain; having a very vulgar stomach. My wife,
and your cousin, Charles, give you their most humble
service, and thanks for your remembrance of
them. I present my own to my worthy cousin,
your husband, and am, with all respect,</p>

<p>For this time I must follow a bad example, and
send you a shorter letter than your short one: you
were hinder’d by dancers, and I am forc’d to dance
attendance all this afternoon after a troublesome
business, so soon as I have written this, and seal’d
it. Onely I can assure you, that your father and
mother, and all your relations, are in health, or
were yesterday, when I sent to enquire of their
welfare. On Tuesday night we had a violent wind,
which blew down three of my chimneys, and dismantled
all one side of my house, by throwing
down the tiles. My neighbours, and indeed all the
town, suffer’d more or less; and some were kill’d.
The great trees in St James’s Park are many of
them torn up from the roots; as they were before
Oliver Cromwell’s death,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and the late queen’s:
but your father had no damage. I sent my man
for the present you designed me; but he return’d
empty-handed; for there was no such man as <i>Carter</i>

<p>I have reason to be pleas’d with writeing to you,
because you are daily giveing me occasions to be
pleas’d. The present which you made me this week,
I have receiv’d; and it will be part of the treat I
am to make to three of my friends about Tuesday
next: my cousin Driden, of Chesterton, having
been also pleas’d to add to it a turkey hen with
eggs, and a good young goose; besides a very kind
letter, and the news of his own good health, which
I vallue more than all the rest; he being so noble
a benefactor to a poor and so undeserving a kinsman,
and one of another persuasion in matters of
religion. Your enquiry of his welfare, and sending
also mine, have at once oblig’d both him and me.
I hope my good cousin Stewart will often visite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
him, especially before hunting goes out,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> to be a
comfort to him in his sorrow for the loss of his
deare brother,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> who was a most extraordinary well-natur’d
man, and much my friend. Exercise, I
know, is my cousin Driden’s life, and the oftner he
goes out will be the better for his health. We poor
Catholics daily expect a most severe proclamation
to come out against us;<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> and at the same time are
satisfyed that the king is very unwilling to persecute
us, considering us to be but an handfull, and
those disarmed; but the archbishop of Canterbury
is our heavy enemy, and heavy indeed he is in all
respects.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>This day was played a revived comedy of Mr
Congreve’s, called “The Double Dealer,” which
was never very takeing. In the play-bill was printed&mdash;“Written
by Mr Congreve; with severall expressions
omitted.” What kind of expressions those
were, you may easily ghess, if you have seen the
Monday’s Gazette, wherein is the king’s order for
the reformation of the stage:<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> but the printing an
author’s name in a play-bill is a new manner of proceeding,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
at least in England. When any papers of
verses in manuscript, which are worth your reading,
come abroad, you shall be sure of them; because,
being a poetess yourself, you like those entertainments.
I am still drudging at a book of Miscellanyes,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
which I hope will be well enough; if otherwise,
threescore and seven may be pardon’d.&mdash;Charles
is not yet so well recover’d as I wish him;
but I may say, without vanity, that his virtue and
sobriety have made him much belov’d in all companies.
Both he and his mother give you their
most humble acknowledgments of your rememb’ring
them. Be pleas’d to give mine to my cousin
Stewart, who am both his and your</p>

your sisters<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> of the trouble I intended you this
summer; and added a petition, that you would
please to order some small beer to be brew’d for
me without hops, or with a very inconsiderable
quantity; because I lost my health last year by
drinking bitter beer at Tichmarsh. It may perhaps
be sour, but I like it not the worse, if it be small
enough. What els I have to request, is onely the
favour of your coach, to meet me at Oundle, and
to convey me to you: of which I shall not fail to
give you timely notice. My humble service attends

<p>Your goodness to me will make you sollicitous
of my welfare since I left Cotterstock. My journey
has in general been as happy as it cou’d be,
without the satisfaction and honour of your company.
’Tis true, the master of the stage-coach has
not been over civill to me: for he turned us out of
the road at the first step, and made us go to Pilton;
there we took in a fair young lady of eighteen, and
her brother, a young gentleman; they are related
to the Treshams, but not of that name: thence we
drove to Higham, where we had an old serving-woman,
and a young fine mayd: we din’d at Bletso,
and lay at Silso, six miles beyond Bedford. There
we put out the old woman, and took in Councellour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Jennings his daughter; her father goeing along
in the Kittering coach, or rideing by it, with other
company. We all din’d at Hatfield together, and
came to town safe at seaven in the evening. We
had a young doctour, who rode by our coach, and
seem’d to have a smickering<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> to our youg lady of
Pilton, and ever rode before to get dinner in a
readiness. My sonn, Charles, knew him formerly
a Jacobite; and now going over to Antigoo, with
Colonel Codrington,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> haveing been formerly in
the West Indies.&mdash;Which of our two young ladies
was the handsomer, I know not. My sonn liked
the Councellour’s daughter best: I thought they
were both equal. But not goeing to Tichmarsh
Grove, and afterwards by Catworth, I missed my
two couple of rabbets, which my cousin, your
father, had given me to carry with me, and cou’d
not see my sister by the way: I was likewise disappointed
of Mr Cole’s Ribadavia wine: but I am
almost resolved to sue the stage coach, for putting
me six or seaven miles out of the way, which he
cannot justify.</p>

<p>Be pleased to accept my acknowledgment of all
your favours, and my Cousin Stuart’s; and by employing
my sonn and me in any thing you desire
to have done, give us occasion to take our revenge
on our kind relations both at Oundle and Cotterstock.
Be pleas’d, your father, your mother, your

his commands, and left onely the praises, which I
think are due to the gallantry of my own countrymen.
In the description which I have made of a
Parliament-man,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> I think I have not only drawn the
features of my worthy kinsman, but have also
given my own opinion of what an Englishman in
Parliament ought to be; and deliver it as a memorial
of my own principles to all posterity. I have
consulted the judgment of my unbyass’d friends,
who have some of them the honour to be known
to you: and they think there is nothing which can
justly give offence in that part of the poem. I say
not this to cast a blind on your judgment, (which I
could not do, if I endeavoured it,) but to assure you,
that nothing relateing to the publique shall stand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
without your permission; for it were to want common
sence to desire your patronage, and resolve to
disoblige you. And as I will not hazard my hopes
of your protection, by refusing to obey you in any
thing which I can perform with my conscience or
my honour, so I am very confident you will never
impose any other terms on me. My thoughts at
present are fix’d on Homer; and by my translation
of the first Iliad, I find him a poet more according
to my genius than Virgil, and consequently hope I
may do him more justice in his fiery way of writeing;
which, as it is liable to more faults, so it is capable
of more beauties, than the exactness and sobriety
of Virgil. Since ’tis for my country’s honour, as
well as for my own, that I am willing to undertake
this task, I despair not of being encourag’d in it by
your favour, who am</p>

</p>

<p>Even your expostulations are pleasing to me; for
though they shew you angry, yet they are not without
many expressions of your kindness; and therefore
I am proud to be so chidden. Yet I cannot
so farr abandon my own defence, as to confess any
idleness or forgetfulness on my part. What has
hind’red me from writeing to you, was neither ill
health, nor, a worse thing, ingratitude; but a flood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of little businesses, which yet are necessary to my
subsistance, and of which I hop’d to have given
you a good account before this time: but the court
rather speaks kindly of me, than does any thing for
me, though they promise largely; and perhaps they
think I will advance as they go backward, in which
they will be much deceiv’d; for I can never go an
inch beyond my conscience and my honour.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> If
they will consider me as a man who has done my
best to improve the language, and especially the
poetry, and will be content with my acquiescence
under the present government, and forbearing satire
on it, that I can promise, because I can perform
it; but I can neither take the oaths, nor forsake
my religion; because I know not what church
to go to, if I leave the Catholique; they are all so
divided amongst them selves in matters of faith necessary
to salvation, and, yet all assumeing the
name of Protestants. May God be pleas’d to open
your eyes, as he has open’d mine! Truth is but one;
and they who have once heard of it, can plead no
excuse, if they do not embrace it. But these are
things too serious for a trifling letter.</p>

<p>If you desire to hear any thing more of my affairs,
the Earl of Dorsett, and your cousin Montague,
have both seen the two poems, to the Duchess of
Ormond, and my worthy cousin Driden; and are
of opinion, that I never writt better. My other
friends are divided in their judgments, which to
preferr; but the greater part are for those to my
dear kinsman; which I have corrected with so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
much care, that they will now be worthy of his
sight, and do neither of us any dishonour after our
death.</p>

<p>There is this day to be acted a new tragedy, made
by Mr Hopkins,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and, as I believe, in rhime. He
has formerly written a play in verse, call’d “Boadicea,”
which you fair ladyes lik’d; and is a poet
who writes good verses without knowing how or
why; I mean, he writes naturally well, without art,
or learning, or good sence. Congreve is ill of the
gout at Barnet Wells. I have had the honour of a
visite from the Earl of Dorsett, and din’d with him.&mdash;Matters
in Scotland are in a high ferment,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> and
next door to a breach betwixt the two nations; but
they say from court, that France and we are hand
and glove. ’Tis thought, the king will endeavour
to keep up a standing army, and make the stirr in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Scotland his pretence for it; my cousin Driden,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
and the country party, I suppose, will be against
it; for when a spirit is rais’d, ’tis hard conjuring
him down again.&mdash;You see I am dull by my writeing
news; but it may be my cousin Creed<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> may
be glad to hear what I believe is true, though not
very pleasing. I hope he recovers health in the
country, by his staying so long in it. My service

<p>The letter you were pleas’d to direct for me, to
be left at the coffee-house last summer, was a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
honour; and your verses<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> were, I thought, too
good to be a woman’s; some of my friends, to
whom I read them, were of the same opinion. ’Tis
not over-gallant, I must confess, to say this of the
fair sex; but most certain it is, that they generally
write with more softness than strength. On the
contrary, you want neither vigour in your thoughts,
nor force in your expressions, nor harmony in your
numbers; and methinks I find much of Orinda<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> in
your manner; to whom I had the honour to be related,
and also to be known. But I continued not
a day in the ignorance of the person to whom I was
oblig’d; for, if you remember, you brought the
verses to a bookseller’s shop, and enquir’d there,
how they might be sent to me. There happen’d to
be in the same shop a gentleman, who heareing you
speak of me, and seeing a paper in your hand, imagin’d
it was a libel against me, and had you watch’d
by his servant, till he knew both your name, and
where you liv’d, of which he sent me word immediately.
Though I have lost his letter, yet I remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
you live some where about St Giles’s,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> and
are an only daughter. You must have pass’d your
time in reading much better books than mine; or
otherwise you cou’d not have arriv’d to so much
knowledge as I find you have. But whether Sylph
or Nymph, I know not: those fine creatures, as
your author, Count Gabalis, assures us,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> have a
mind to be christen’d, and since you do me the favour
to desire a name from me, take that of Corinna,
if you please; I mean not the lady with whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Ovid was in love, but the famous Theban poetess,
who overcame Pindar five times, as historians tell
us. I would have call’d you Sapho, but that I hear
you are handsomer. Since you find I am not altogether
a stranger to you, be pleas’d to make me
happier by a better knowledge of you; and in stead
of so many unjust praises which you give me, think
me only worthy of being,</p>

<p>The great desire which I observe in you to write
well, and those good parts which God Almighty
and nature have bestow’d on you, make me not to
doubt, that, by application to study, and the reading
of the best authors, you may be absolute mistress
of poetry. ’Tis an unprofitable art to those
who profess it; but you, who write only for your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
diversion, may pass your hours with pleasure in it,
and without prejudice; always avoiding (as I know
you will,) the licence which Mrs Behn<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> allow’d
her self, of writeing loosely, and giveing, if I may
have leave to say so, some scandall to the modesty
of her sex. I confess, I am the last man who ought,
in justice, to arraign her, who have been my self
too much a libertine in most of my poems; which
I shou’d be well contented I had time either to
purge, or to see them fairly burn’d. But this I
need not say to you, who are too well born, and too
well principled, to fall into that mire.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I would advise you not to trust
too much to Virgil’s Pastorals; for as excellent as
they are, yet Theocritus is far before him, both in
softness of thought, and simplicity of expression.
Mr Creech has translated that Greek poet, which
I have not read in English. If you have any considerable
faults, they consist chiefly in the choice
of words, and the placeing them so as to make the
verse run smoothly; but I am at present so taken
up with my own studies, that I have not leisure to
descend to particulars; being, in the mean time,

<p>After a long expectation, Madam, at length
your happy letter came to your servant, who almost
despair’d of it. The onely comfort I had, was,
my hopes of seeing you, and that you defer’d writeing,
because you wou’d surprise me with your presence,
and beare your relations company to town.&mdash;Your
neighbour, Mr Price, has given me an apprehension,
that my cousin, your father, is in some
danger of being made sheriff the following yeare;
but I hope ’tis a jealousy without ground, and that
the warm season only keeps him in the country.&mdash;If
you come up next week, you will be entertain’d
with a new tragedy, which the author of it, one
Mr Dennis, cries up at an excessive rate; and Colonel
Codrington, who has seen it, prepares the
world to give it loud applauses. ’Tis called “Iphigenia,”
and imitated from Euripides, an old Greek
poet.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> This is to be acted at Betterton’s house;
and another play of the same name is very shortly
to come on the stage in Drury-Lane.&mdash;I was lately
to visite the Duchess of Norfolk;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> and she speaks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
of you with much affection and respect. Your cousin
Montague,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> after the present session of parliament,
will be created Earl of Bristoll.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> and I hope
is much my friend: but I doubt I am in no condition
of having a kindness done, having the Chancellour<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
my enemy; and not being capable of renounceing
the cause for which I have so long suffer’d,&mdash;My
cousin Driden of Chesterton is in town,
and lodges with my brother in Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> My
sonn has seen him, and was very kindly received
by him.&mdash;Let this letter stand for nothing, because
it has nothing but news in it, and has so little of
the main business, which is to assure my fair cousine
how much I am her admirer, and her</p>

<p>When I have either too much business or want
of health, to write to you, I count my time is lost,
or at least my conscience accuses me that I spend
it ill. At this time my head is full of cares, and
my body ill at ease. My book is printing,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and
my bookseller makes no hast. I had last night at
bed-time an unwelcome fit of vomiting; and my
sonn, Charles, lyes sick upon his bed with the colique,
which has been violent upon him for almost
a week. With all this, I cannot but remember
that you accus’d me of barbarity, I hope in jeast
onely, for mistaking one sheriff for another, which
proceeded from my want of heareing well. I am
heartily sorry that a chargeable office is fallen on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
my cousin Stuart.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> But my Cousin Driden comforts
me, that it must have come one time or other,
like the small-pox; and better have it young than
old. I hope it will leave no great marks behind it,
and that your fortune will no more feel it than your
beauty, by the addition of a year’s wearing. My
cousine, your mother, was heer yesterday, to see my
wife, though I had not the happiness to be at home.&mdash;Both
the “Iphigenias” have been play’d with bad
success;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> and being both acted one against the
other in the same week, clash’d together, like two
rotten ships which could not endure the shock, and
sunk to rights. The King’s proclamation against
vice and profaneness is issued out in print;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> but a
deep disease is not to be cur’d with a slight medicine.
The parsons, who must read it, will find as
little effect from it, as from their dull sermons: ’tis
a scare-crow, which will not fright many birds from
preying on the fields and orchards. The best news
I heare is, that the land will not be charg’d very
deep this yeare: let that comfort you for your

the rose, I am of opinion, that much of the confidence
is abated on either side, and that whensoever
they meet next, it will give that House a farther
occasion of encroaching on the prerogative and
the Lords; for they, who beare the purse, will rule.
The Parliament being risen, my cousin Driden will
immediately be with you, and, I believe, return his
thanks in person. All this while I am lame at home,
and have not stirr’d abroad this moneth at least.
Neither my wife nor Charles are well, but have intrusted
their service in my hand. I humbly add
my own to the unwilling High Sheriff,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> and wish
him fairly at an end of his trouble.</p>

<p>The latter end of last week, I had the honour of
a visite from my cousine, your mother, and my
cousine Dorothy, with which I was much comforted.
Within this moneth there will be play’d, for
my profit, an old play of Fletcher’s, call’d the “Pilgrim,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
corrected by my good friend Mr Vanbrook;<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
to which I have added a new masque; and am to
write a new prologue and epilogue. Southern’s tragedy,
call’d the “Revolt of Capua,” will be play’d
at Betterton’s house within this fortnight. I am
out with that Company, and therefore, if I can help
it, will not read it before ’tis acted, though the authour
much desires I shou’d. Do not think I will
refuse a present from fair hands; for I am resolv’d
to save my bacon. I beg your pardon for this slovenly
letter; but I have not health to transcribe
it.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> My service to my cousin, your brother, who,

<p>We may add to these accounts the Description of the Funeral itself,

spectator.</p></blockquote>

<p>“A deeper concern hath scarce been known to
affect in general the minds of grateful and ingenious
men, than the melancholy surprise of the worthy
Mr Dryden’s death hath occasioned through the
whole town, as well as in all other parts of the kingdom,
where any persons either of wit or learning
have taken up their residence. Wheresoever his incomparable
writings have been scattered by the
hands of the travellers into foreign nations, the loss
of so great a man must needs be lamented amongst
their bards and rabbies; and ’tis reasonable to believe
the commendable industry of translations has
been such, to render several of his most accurate
performances into their own language, that their
native country might receive the benefit, and themselves
the reputation of so laudable an undertaking:
and how far the wings of merit have conveyed the
pleasing fruits of his exuberant fancy, is a difficult
conjecture, considering what a continual correspondence
our nation has with most parts of the universe.
For it is reasonable to believe all Christian
kingdoms and colonies at least, have been as much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the better for his labours, as the world is the worse
for the loss of him. Those who were his enemies
while he was living, (for no man lives without,) his
death has now made such friends to his memory,
that they acknowledge they cannot but in justice
give him this character, that he was one of the
greatest scholars, the most correct dramatic poet,
and the best writer of heroic verse, that any age has
produced in England. And yet, to verify the old
proverb, that poets, like prophets, have little honour
in their own countries, notwithstanding his
merits had justly entitled his corpse to the most magnificent
and solemn interment the beneficence of the
greatest spirits could have bestowed on him; yet,
’tis credibly reported, the ingratitude of the age is
such, that they had like to have let him pass in private
to his grave, without those funeral obsequies
suitable to his greatness, had it not been for that
true British worthy, who, meeting with the venerable
remains of the neglected bard passing silently
in a coach, unregarded to his last home, ordered
the corpse, by the consent of his few friends that attended
him, to be respited from so obscure an interment,
and most generously undertook, at his own
expence, to revive his worth in the minds of a forgetful
people, by bestowing on his peaceful dust a
solemn funeral answerable to his merit; which memorable
action alone will eternalize his fame with
the greatest heroes, and add that lustre to his nobility,
which time can never tarnish, but will shine
with equal glory in all ages, and in the very teeth of
envy bid defiance to oblivion. The management of
the funeral was left to Mr Russel, pursuant to the
directions of that honourable great man the lord
Jefferies, concerned chiefly in the pious undertaking.</p>

<p>“The first honour done to his deserving relics, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
lodging them in Physicians College, from whence
they were appointed to take their last remove. The
constituted day for the celebration of that office,
which living heroes perform in respect to a dead
worthy, was Monday the 13th of May, in the afternoon;
at which time, according to the notice
given, most of the nobility and gentry now in town
assembled themselves together at the noble edifice
aforesaid, in order to honour the corpse with their
personal attendance. When the company were met,
a performance of grave music, adapted to the solemn
occasion, was communicated to the ears of the
company, by the hands of the best masters in England,
whose artful touches on their soft instruments
diffused such harmonious influence amongst the attentive
auditory, that the most heroic spirits in the
whole assembly were unable to resist the passionate
force of each dissolving strain, but melted into tears
for the loss of so elegant and sweet a ravisher of
human minds; and, notwithstanding their undaunted
bravery, which had oft scorned death in the
field, yet now, by music’s enchantment at the funeral
of so great a poet, were softened beneath their
own natures, into a serious reflection on mortality.</p>

<p>“When this part of the solemnity was ended, the
famous Doctor G&mdash;&mdash;th ascended the pulpit where
the physicians make their lectures, and delivered,
according to the Roman custom, a funeral oration
in Latin on his deceased friend, which he performed
with great approbation and applause of all such
gentlemen that heard him, and were true judges of
the matter; most rhetorically setting forth those
elegies and encomiums which no poet hitherto, but
the great Dryden, could ever truly deserve. When
these rites were over in the College, the corpse, by
bearers for that purpose, was handed into the hearse,
being adorned with plumes of black feathers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
the sides hung round with the escutcheons of his
ancestors, mixed with that of his lady’s; the hearse
drawn by six stately Flanders horses; every thing
being set off with the most useful ornaments to
move regard, and affect the memories of the numberless
spectators, as a means to encourage every
sprightly genius to attempt something in their
lives that may once render their dust worthy of so
public a veneration. All things being put in due
order for their movement, they began their solemn
procession towards Westminster Abbey, after the
following manner:</p>

<p>“The two beadles of the College marched first, in
mourning cloaks and hat-bands, with the heads of
their staffs wrapt in black crape scarfs, being followed
by several other servile mourners, whose business
was to prepare the way, that the hearse might
pass less liable to interruption; next to these moved
a concert of hautboys and trumpets, playing and
sounding together a melancholy funeral-march, undoubtedly
composed upon that particular occasion;
(after these, the undertaker with his hat off, dancing
through the dirt like a bear after a bagpipe.
I beg the reader’s pardon for foisting in a jest in so
improper a place, but as he walked by himself
within a parenthesis, so I have here placed him, and
hope none will be offended;) then came the hearse,
as before described, most honourably attended with
abundance of quality in their coaches and six horses;
that it may be justly reported to posterity, no
ambassador from the greatest emperor in all the
universe, sent over with the welcome embassy to
the throne of England, ever made his public entry
to the court with half that honour as the corpse of
the great Dryden did its last exit to the grave. In
this order the nobility and gentry attended the
hearse to Westminster Abbey, where the quire, assisted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
with the best masters in England, sung an
Epicedium; and the last funeral rites being performed
by one of the prebends, he was honourably
interred between Chaucer and Cowley; where, according
to report, will be erected a very stately monument,
at the expence of some of the nobility, in
order to recommend his worth, and to preserve his
memory to all succeeding ages.”

DRYDEN’S DEATH AND FUNERAL;<br />

<span class="small"><i>Extracted from Wilson’s Life of Congreve, 1730.</i></span></h2>


<p class="hang">[As tales of wonder are generally acceptable to the public, I insert
these memorable Epistles, with the necessary caveat, that
they are full of every kind of blunder and inconsistency.]</p>

<p>“These Memoirs were communicated to me by a
lady, now living, with whom Mr Dryden corresponded
under the name of Corinna, and which
name he himself gave her.</p>

<p>’<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>’Mr Dryden was son of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Dryden, of an
ancient and good family in Northamptonshire, by
a sister of Sir Gilbert Pickering, Bart. of the same
county; who has a handsome monument at Tichmarsh,
erected in 1721, by the late widow Creed
of Oundle, the daughter of another sister of Sir Gilbert’s,
and niece to the famous Earl of Sandwich,
who was killed in the Dutch war, 1667, being then
admiral. He married Lady Elizabeth Howard, (a
celebrated beauty) daughter to the old Earl of
Berkshire, sister to Sir Robert Howard, Colonel
Philip Howard, and Mr Edward Howard: (who
wrote “The British Prince,” &amp;c.;) she bore him
three sons, Charles, John, and Harry. He lived
many years in a very good house in Gerrard street,
the 5th or 6th door on the left-hand from Newport-market.
On the 19th of April, 1700, he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
he had been very bad with the gout, and an erysipelas
in one leg; but he was then very well, and
designed to go soon abroad: but on the Friday
following, he had eat a partridge for his supper;
and going to take a turn in the little garden behind
his house, was seized with a violent pain under
the ball of the great-toe of his right-foot, that,
unable to stand, he cried out for help, and was carried
in by his servants; when, upon sending for
surgeons, they found a small black spot in the
place affected: He submitted to their present applications;
and when gone, called his son Charles
to him, using these words, “I know,” says he, “this
black spot is a mortification; I know also, that it
will seize my head, and that they will cut off my
leg: but I command you, my son, by your filial duty,
that you do not suffer me to be dismembered.”
As he, too truly, foretold, the event proved; and
his son was too dutiful to disobey his father’s commands.
On the Wednesday morning following,
being May-day, 1700, under the most excruciating
dolours, he died. Dr Sprat, then bishop of Rochester,
sent, on the Thursday, to Lady Elizabeth,
that he would make a present of the ground, which
was 40l. with all the other abbey-fees, &amp;c. to his
deceased friend. Lord Halifax sent also to my lady
and Mr Charles, that if they would give him leave
to bury Mr Dryden, he would inter him with a gentleman’s
private funeral, and afterwards bestow
500l. on a monument in the Abbey; which, as they
had no reason to refuse, they accepted. On the Saturday
following the company came, the corpse was
put into a velvet hearse, and eighteen mourning
coaches, filled with company, attending. When,
just before they began to move, Lord Jefferies,
with some of his rakish companions, coming by,
in wine, asked, whose funeral? and being told,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
“What!” cries he, “shall Dryden, the greatest
honour and ornament of the nation, be buried after
this private manner? No, gentlemen; let all that
loved Mr Dryden, and honour his memory, alight,
and join with me in gaining my lady’s consent, to
let me have the honour of his interment, which
shall be after another manner than this, and I will
bestow 1000l. on a monument in the Abbey for
him.” The gentlemen in the coaches not knowing
of the bishop of Rochester’s favour, nor of Lord
Halifax’s generous design, (these two noble spirits
having, out of respect to the family, enjoined Lady
Elizabeth and her son to keep their favour concealed
to the world, and let it pass for her own expence,
&amp;c.), readily came out of the coaches, and
attended Lord Jefferies up to the lady’s bed-side,
who was then sick, He repeated the purport of
what he had before said; but she absolutely refusing,
he fell on his knees, vowing never to rise till
his request was granted. The rest of the company,
by his desire, kneeled also; she being naturally
of a timorous disposition, and then under a sudden
surprise, fainted away. As soon as she recovered
her speech, she cried, no, no. Enough, gentlemen,
replied he, (rising briskly,) my lady is very
good; she says, go, go. She repeated her former
words with all her strength, but, alas! in vain, her
feeble voice was lost in their acclamations of joy;
and Lord Jefferies ordered the hearsemen to carry
the corpse to Russell’s, the undertaker, in Cheapside,
and leave it there, till he sent orders for the
embalment, which, he added, should be after the
royal manner. His directions were obeyed, the
company dispersed, and Lady Elizabeth and Mr
Charles remained inconsolable. Next morning Mr
Charles waited on Lord Halifax, &amp;c. to excuse his
mother and self, by relating the real truth: but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
neither his lordship, nor the bishop, would admit
of any plea; especially the latter, who had the Abbey
lighted, the ground opened, the choir attending,
an anthem ready set, and himself waiting, for
some hours, without any corpse to bury, Russel,
after three days expectance of orders for embalment,
without receiving any, waits on Lord Jefferies,
who, pretending ignorance of the matter, turned
it off with an ill-natured jest, saying, “Those
who observed the orders of a drunken frolic, deserved
no better; that he remembered nothing at all
of it, and he might do what he pleased with the
corpse.” On this Mr Russell waits on Lady Elizabeth
and Mr Dryden; but, alas! it was not in their
power to answer. The season was very hot, the deceased
had lived high and fast; and being corpulent,
and abounding with gross humours, grew very
offensive. The undertaker, in short, threatened to
bring home the corpse, and set it before their door.
It cannot be easily imagined, what grief, shame,
and confusion, seized this unhappy family. They
begged a day’s respite, which was granted. Mr
Charles wrote a very handsome letter to Lord Jefferies,
who returned it, with this cool answer, “He
knew nothing of the matter, and would be troubled
no more about it.” He then addressed the Lord
Halifax and bishop of Rochester, who were both
too justly, though unhappily, incensed, to do any
thing in it. In this extreme distress, Dr Garth, a
man who entirely loved Mr Dryden, and was withal
a man of generosity and great humanity, sends for
the corpse to the College of Physicians in Warwicklane,
and proposed a funeral by subscription, to
which himself set a most noble example; Mr Wycherley,
and several others, among whom must not
be forgotten, Henry Cromwell, Esq. Captain Gibbons,
and Mr Christopher Metcalfe, Mr Dryden’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
apothecary and intimate friend, (since a collegiate
physician,) who, with many others, contributed
most largely to the subscription; and at last a day,
about three weeks after his decease, was appointed
for the interment at the Abbey. Dr Garth pronounced
a fine Latin oration over the corpse at the
College; but the audience being numerous, and the
room large, it was requisite the orator should be
elevated, that he might be heard; but, as it unluckily
happened, there was nothing at hand but
an old beer-barrel, which the doctor, with much
good-nature, mounted; and, in the midst of his
oration, beating time to the accent with his foot,
the head broke in, and his feet sunk to the bottom,
which occasioned the malicious report of his
enemies, that he was turned a tub-preacher: However,
he finished the oration with a superior grace
and genius, to the loud acclamations of mirth,
which inspired the mixed or rather mob-auditors.
The procession began to move, a numerous train of
coaches attended the hearse; but, good God! in
what disorder, can only be expressed by a sixpenny
pamphlet, soon after published, entitled, “Dryden’s
Funeral.” At last the corpse arrived at the Abbey,
which was all unlighted. No organ played, no anthem
sung; only two of the singing boys preceded
the corpse, who sung an ode of Horace, with each a
small candle in their hand. The butchers and other
mob broke in like a deluge, so that only about eight
or ten gentlemen could get admission, and those
forced to cut the way with their drawn swords.
The coffin, in this disorder, was let down into Chaucer’s
grave, with as much confusion, and as little
ceremony, as was possible; every one glad to save
themselves from the gentlemen’s swords, or the
clubs of the mob. When the funeral was over, Mr
Charles sent a challenge to Lord Jefferies, who refusing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to answer it, he sent several others, and went
often himself, but could neither get a letter delivered,
nor admittance to speak to him; which so
justly incensed him, that he resolved, since his
lordship refused to answer him like a gentleman, he
would watch an opportunity to meet him, and fight
off hand, though with all the rules of honour; which
his lordship hearing, left the town; and Mr Charles
could never have the satisfaction to meet him,
though he sought it till his death with the utmost
application. This is the true state of the case, and
surely no reflection to the manes of this great man.</p>

<p>“Thus it is very plain, that his being buried by
contribution, was owing to a vile drunken frolic of
the Lord Jefferies, as I have related. Mr Dryden enjoyed
himself in plenty, while he lived, and the surplusage
of his goods paid all his debts. After his
decease, the Lady Elizabeth, his widow, took a lesser
house in Sherrard-street, Golden-square, and had
wherewithal to live frugally genteel, and keep two
servants, to the day of her death, by the means of a
small part of her fortune, which her relations had
obliged Mr Dryden to secure to her on marriage.
This was 80l. per annum, and duly paid at 20l. per
quarter; so that, I can assure you, there was no
want to her dying-day. He had only three sons,
and all provided for like gentlemen. Mr Charles
had served the Pontiff of Rome above nine years,
in an honourable and profitable post, as usher to the
palace, out of which he had an handsome stipend
remitted by his brother John, whom, by the pope’s
favour, he left to officiate, while he came to visit his
father, who dying soon after his arrival, he returned
no more to Italy, but was unhappily drowned at
Windsor in swimming cross the river. Mr John
died in his post at Rome, and Harry the youngest
was a religious; he had 30l. a year allowed by his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
college in Flanders, besides a generous salary from
his near relation the too well-known Duchess of
Norfolk, to whom he was domestic chaplain. Behold
the great wants of this deplorable family!</p>

</p>

<p><i>May</i> 15, 1729.</p>

<p>P. S. ‘Mr Dryden was educated at Westminster
school, under the great Dr Bushby, being one of
the king’s scholars upon the royal foundation.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>’<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>’Upon recollection, I think it must have been
that remarkably fine gentleman, Pope Clement XI.,
to whom Mr Charles Dryden was usher of the palace.
His brother John died of a fever at Rome,
not many months after his father, and was buried
there; whether before the pope or after I cannot
say; but the difference was not much. Mr Charles,
who was drowned at Windsor, 1704, was doubtless
buried there. Lady Elizabeth lived about eight years
after her spouse, and for five years of the time, without
any memory, which she lost by a fever in 1703;
she was a melancholy object, and was, by her son
Harry, as I was told, carried into the country,
where she died. What country I never heard. I
cannot certainly say where Mr Harry died, or whether
before his mother or after.</p>

<p>’Mr Dryden never had any wife but Lady Elizabeth,
whatever may have been reported.</p>

<p>’As he was a man of a versatile genius, he took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
great delight in judicial astrology; though only by
himself. There were some incidents which proved
his great skill, that were related to Lady Chudleigh
at the Bath, and which she desired me to ask Lady
Elizabeth about, as I after did; which she not only
confirmed, by telling me the exact matter of fact,
but added another, which had never been told to
any; and which I can solemnly aver was some
years before it came to pass. I purposely omitted
these Narratives in the Memoirs of Mr Dryden,
lest that this over-witty age, which so much ridicules
prescience, should think the worse of all the
rest; but, if you desire particulars, they shall be
freely at your service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><i>The Narratives referred to in the foregoing Letter,
viz.</i></p>

<p>’Notwithstanding Mr Dryden was a great master
of that branch of astronomy, called judicial astrology,
there were very few, scarce any, the most
intimate of his friends, who knew of his amusements
that way, except his own family. In the
year 1707, that deservedly celebrated Lady Chudleigh
being at the Bath, was told by the Lady Elizabeth
of a very surprising instance of this judgement
on his eldest son Charles’s horoscope. Lady
Chudleigh, whose superior genius rendered her as
little credulous on the topic of prescience, as she
was on that of apparitions; yet withal was of so
candid and curious a disposition, that she neither
credited an attested tale on the quality or character
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of the relater, nor did she altogether despise it,
though told by the most ignorant: Her steady zeal
for truth always led her to search to the foundation,
of it; and on that principle, at her return to London,
she spoke to a gentlewoman of her acquaintance,
that was well acquainted in Mr Dryden’s family,
to ask his widow about it; which she accordingly
did. It is true, report has added many incidents
to matter of fact; but the real truth, taken
from Lady Elizabeth’s own mouth, is in these words:</p>

<p>‘When I was in labour of Charles, Mr Dryden
being told it was decent to withdraw, laid his watch
on the table, begging one of the ladies, then present,
in a most solemn manner, to take an exact
notice of the very minute when the child was born:
which she did, and acquainted him therewith. This
passed without any singular notice; many fathers having
had such a fancy, without any farther thought.
But about a week after, when I was pretty hearty,
he comes into my room; ‘My dear,’ says he, ‘you
little think what I have been doing this morning;’
“nor ever shall,” said I, “unless you will be so
good to inform me.” ‘Why, then,’ cried he, ‘I have
been calculating this child’s nativity, and in grief I
speak it, he was born in an evil hour; Jupiter, Venus,
and the Sun, were all under the earth, and the
lord of his ascendant afflicted by a hateful square
of Mars and Saturn. If he lives to arrive at his
eighth year, he will go near to die a violent death
on his very birth-day; but if he should escape, as I
see but small hopes, he will, in his twenty-third
year, be under the very same evil direction: and if
he should, which seems almost impossible, escape
that also, the thirty-third or thirty-fourth year is, I
fear’&mdash;&mdash;I interrupted him here, “O, Mr Dryden,
what is this you tell me? my blood runs cold at
your fatal speech; recal it, I beseech you. Shall my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
little angel, my Dryden boy, be doomed to so hard
a fate? Poor innocent, what hast thou done? No:
I will fold thee in my arms, and if thou must
fall, we will both perish together.” A flood of tears
put a stop to my speech; and through Mr Dryden’s
comfortable persuasions, and the distance of time, I
began to be a little appeased, but always kept the
fatal period in my mind. At last the summer arrived,
August was the inauspicious month in which
my dear son was to enter on his eighth year. The
court being in progress, and Mr Dryden at leisure,
he was invited to my brother Berkshire’s to keep
the long vacation with him at Charleton in Wilts;
I was also invited to my uncle Mordaunt’s, to pass
the remainder of the summer at his country-seat.
All this was well enough; but when we came to
dividing the children, I would have had him took
John, and let me have the care of Charles; because,
as I told him, a man might be engaged in company,
but a woman could have no pretence for not
guarding of the evil hour. Poor Mr Dryden was in
this too absolute, and I as positive. In fine, we
parted in anger; and, as a husband always will be
master, he took Charles, and I was forced to be
content with my son John. But when the fatal day
approached, such anguish of heart seized me, as
none but a fond mother can form any idea of. I
watched the post; that failed: I wrote and wrote,
but no answer. Oh, my friend! judge what I endured,
terrified with dreams, tormented by my apprehensions.
I abandoned myself to despair, and
remained inconsolable.</p>

<p>’The anxiety of my spirits occasioned such an
effervescence of my blood, as threw me into so violent
a fever, that my life was despaired of, when a
letter came from my spouse, reproving my womanish
credulity, and assured me all was well, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
child in perfect health; on which I mended daily,
and recovered my wonted state of ease, till about
six weeks after the fatal day, I received an <i>eclaircissement</i>
from Mr Dryden, with a full account of
the whole truth, which belike he feared to acquaint
me with till the danger was over. It was this: In
the month of August, being Charles’s anniversary,
it happened, that Lord Berkshire had made a general
hunting-match, to which were invited all the
adjacent gentlemen; Mr Dryden being at his house,
and his brother-in-law, could not be dispensed with
from appearing.</p>

<p>’I have told you, that Mr Dryden, either through
fear of being thought superstitious, or thinking it a
science beneath his study, was extremely cautious
in letting any one know that he was a dabbler in
astrology, therefore could not excuse his absence
from the sport; but he took care to set the boy a
double exercise in the Latin tongue, (which he
taught his children himself,) with a strict charge
not to stir out of the room till his return, well
knowing the task he had set him would take up
longer time. Poor Charles was all obedience, and
sat close to his duty, when, as ill fate ordained, the
stag made towards the house. The noise of the
dogs, horns, &amp;c. alarmed the family to partake of
the sport; and one of the servants coming down
stairs, the door being open, saw the child hard at
his exercise without being moved. ‘Master,’ cried
the fellow, ‘why do you sit there? come down,
come down, and see the sport.’ ‘No,’ replied Charles,
’my papa has forbid me, and I dare not.’ ‘Pish!’
quoth the clown, ‘vather shall never know it;’ so
takes the child by the hand, and leads him away;
when, just as they came to the gate, the stag, being
at bay with the dogs, cut a bold stroke, and leaped
over the court-wall, which was very low and very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
old, and the dogs following, threw down at once a
part of the wall ten yards in length, under which
my dear child lay buried. He was as soon as possible
dug out; but, alas, how mangled! his poor
little head being crushed to a perfect mash. In this
miserable condition he continued above six weeks,
without the least hope of life. Through the Divine
Providence he recovered, and in process of time,
having a most advantageous invitation to Rome,
from my uncle, Cardinal Howard, we sent over our
two sons Charles and John; (having, through the
grace of God, been ourselves admitted into the true
Catholic faith;) they were received suitable to the
grandeur and generosity of his eminence, and Charles
immediately planted in a post of honour, as gentleman-usher
to his Holiness, in which he continued
about nine years. But what occasions me to mention
this, is an allusion to my dear Mr Dryden’s too
fatal prediction. In his twenty-third year, being in
perfect health, he had attended some ladies of the
palace, his Holiness’s nieces, as it was his place, on
a party of pleasure. His brother John and he lodged
together, at the top of an old round tower belonging
to the Vatican, (with a well staircase, much
like the Monument,) when he knew his brother
Charles was returned, went up, thinking to find
him there, and to go to bed. But, alas! no brother
was there: on which he made a strict enquiry at
all the places he used to frequent, but no news,
more than that he was seen by the centinel to go
up the staircase. On which he got an order for
the door of the foundation of the tower to be opened,
where they found my poor unfortunate son
Charles mashed to a mummy, and weltering in his
own blood. How this happened, he gave no farther
account, when he could speak, than, that the
heat of the day had been most excessive, and as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
came to the top of the tower, he found himself
seized with a megrim, or swimming in his head,
and leaning against the iron rails, it is to be supposed,
tipped over, five stories deep. Under this
grievous mischance, his Holiness (God bless him!)
omitted nothing that might conduce to his recovery;
but as he lay many months without hopes of
life, so when he did recover his health, it was always
very imperfect, and he continues still to be of
a hectic disposition.</p>

<p>’You see here (continued Lady Elizabeth) the too
true fulfilling of two of my dear husband’s fatal predictions.
But, alas! my friend, there is a third to
come, which is, that in his thirty-third or thirty-fourth
year, he or I shall die a violent death; but
he could not say which would go first. I heartily
pray it may be myself: But as I have ten thousand
fears, the daily challenges Charles sends to Lord
Jefferies, on his ungenerous treatment of my dear
Mr Dryden’s corpse; and as he has some value for
you, I beg, my dearest friend, that you would dissuade
him as much as you can from taking that sort
of justice on Lord Jefferies, lest it should fulfil his
dear father’s prediction.’</p>

<p>“Thus far Lady Elizabeth’s own words.</p>

<p>“This, if required, I can solemnly attest was long
before Mr Charles died; to the best of my remembrance
it was in 1701 or 1702, I will not be positive
which. But in 1703, Lady Elizabeth was seized
with a nervous fever, which deprived her of her
memory and understanding, (which surely may be
termed a moral death,) though she lived some years
after. But Mr Charles, in August 1704, was unhappily
drowned at Windsor, as before recited. He
had, with another gentleman, swam twice over the
Thames; but venturing a third time, it was supposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
he was taken with the cramp, because he
called out for help, though too late.</p>

<h3>THE PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="table right">
<span class="trow"><i>1699. 13. June.</i></span></p>

<p> ... And though I am not an author confirmed
enough to carry my copies about to gentlemen’s
chambers, in order to pick up amendments
and corrections, as the practice is now of our most
received writers; yet I must, in justice to myself,
and the gentleman who has favoured me with its
perusal, tell the world, it had been much worse had
not Mr Dryden acquainted me with its faults. Nothing
indeed was so displeasing to him, as what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
was pleasing to myself, viz. his own commendations:
and if it pleases the world, the reader has no
one to thank but so distinguishing a judgment who
occasioned it.</p>

<p>I might here lay hold of the opportunity of returning
the obliging compliments he sent me by the
person who brought the papers to him before they
were printed; but I may chance to call his judgement
in question by it, which I always accounted
infallible, but in his kind thoughts of me; and therefore
refer the reader to the poem, in order to see
whether he’ll be so good natured as to join his opinion
with the compliment the gentleman aforesaid
has honoured me with.</p>


<h3>POEM.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But thou, great bard, whose hoary merits claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laureat’s place, without the laureat’s name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose learned brows, encircled by the bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bespeak their owner’s, and their giver’s praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, Dryden, should’st our loss alone relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heroes mourn, who heroes canst create.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst thy verse the wife already shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And owes her virtues, what she owes thy lines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from above the saint our sorrows views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feels a second heaven in thy muse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose verse as lasting as her fame shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thou shall live by her, and she by thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! let the same immortal numbers tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How just the husband lived, and how he fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What vows, when living, for his life were made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What floods of tears at his decease were paid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since their deathless virtues were the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal in worth, alike should be their fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, withdrawn from us, and public cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flatter’st thy age, and feed’st thy growing years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Supine, unmoved, regardless of our cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mind’st not where thy noble patron lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in death’s icy arms, within his urn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold him sleeping, and, beholding, mourn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless that tongue for wholesome counsels famed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without sight those eyes for lust unblamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bereaved of motion are those hands which gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alms to the needy, did the needy crave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! such a sight, and such a man divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does only call for such a hand as thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great is the task, and worthy is thy pen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of bards should sing the best of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Awake, arise from thy lethargic state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn Britain’s loss, though Britain be ingrate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let the sacred Mantuan’s labours be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>ne plus ultra</i> to thy fame and thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Abingdon, if once thy glorious theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall vie with his Marcellus for esteem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears in his eyes, and sorrow in his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall speak the reader’s grief, and writer’s art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though this barren age does not produce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A great Augustus, to reward thy muse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though in this isle no good Octavia reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives thee Virgil’s premium for his strains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, Dryden, for a while forsake thy ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quit thy pleasures, that thou more may’st please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo calls, and every muse attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every grace, who every beauty lends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is thy voice, as was thy subject’s mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like his soul, thy numbers unconfined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy language easy, and thy flowing song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft as a vale, but like a mountain strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such verse as thine, and such alone, should dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To charge the muses with their present care.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thine, and the cause of wit, with speed maintain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest some rude hand the sacred work profane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dull, mercenary, rhyming crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rob the deceased and thee, of what’s your due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such fears as these, (if duty cannot move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make thy labours equal to thy love,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should hasten forth thy verse, and make it show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thou, mankind, and every muse does owe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Abingdon’s high worth exalted shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives and takes a lustre from thy lines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Eleonora’s pious deeds revive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him who shared her praises when alive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the stern Greek, whom nothing could persuade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quit the rash engagements which he made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sullen looks, and helmet laid aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He soothed his anger, and indulged his pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of fate, neglectful of the call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of chiefs entreating, till Patroclus’ fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused by his death, his martial soul could bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lose his whole resentments in his friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to the dusky field he winged his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes impatient, and redoubled force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeped him dead, in thousands of the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom living, Greece had beg’d his sword in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Dryden! quick the sacred pencil take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rise in virtue’s cause for virtue’s sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven’s the song, and heaven-born is thy muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitting to follow bliss, which mine will lose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold are thy thoughts, and soaring is thy flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fancy tempting, thy expressions bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving thy grief, and powerful is thy praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to command our tears, or joys to raise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall his worth, from age to age conveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shew what the hero did, and poet paid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And future times shall practice what they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performed so well by him, and praised by thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I confess the weakness of my lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give my wonder where thou giv’st thy praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I from every muse but thine retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him in thee, and thee in him, admire.<br /></span>

EXTRACTS<br />
<span class="small">FROM</span><br />
POEMS ATTACKING DRYDEN,<br />
<span class="small">FOR HIS SILENCE UPON</span><br />
THE DEATH OF QUEEN MARY.</h2>


<p>The author of one of these Mourning Odes inscribes
it to Dryden with the following letter:</p>

<p class="i4">
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Though I have little acquaintance with you, nor
desire to have more, I take upon me, with the assurance
of a poet, to make this dedication to you,
which I hope you will the more easily excuse, since
you have often used the same freedom to others;
and since I protest sincerely, that I expect no money
from you.</p>

<p>I could not forbear mentioning your admired
Lewis, whom you compare to Augustus, as justly as
one may compare you to Virgil. Augustus (though
not the most exact pattern of a prince) yet, on some
occasions, shewed personal valour, and was not a
league-breaker, a poisoner, a pirate: Virgil was a
good man and a clean poet; all his excellent writings
may be carried by a child in one hand more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
easily, than all your almonzors can be by a porter
upon both shoulders.</p>

<p>When I saw your prodigious epistle to the translation
of Juvenal, I feared you were wheeling to the
government; I confess too, I long expected something
from you on the late sad occasion, that has
employed so many pens; but it is well that you have
kept silence. I hope you will always be on the other
side; did even popery ever get any honour by you?
You may wonder that I subscribe not my name at
length, but I defer that to another time. I hear
you are translating again; let English Virgil be
better than English Juvenal, or it is odds you will
hear of me more at large. In the mean time, hoping
that you and your covey will dislike what I <i>have
written</i>, I remain, Sir, your very humble servant,</p>

<p class="table right">
<span class="trow">A. B.</span></p>

<p>There is also an attack upon our author, as presiding
in the Wits Coffee-house, which gives us
a curious view into the interior of that celebrated
place of rendezvous. It is entitled, “Urania’s
Temple; or, a Satire upon the Silent Poets,” and
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">On that great theme what wonders had he told!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though the bard, the quill is not grown old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writes young Apollo still, with his whole rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircled and enriched, though not his bays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus when the wreath, so long, so justly due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Mec&aelig;nas from those brows withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pain he saw such merit sunk so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shamed that the dragon’s tail swept down the star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that the conscience-shackle tied so hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had he been the prophet, as the bard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prognostick’d the diminutive slender birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His seven-hill’d mountain-labour has brought forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His foreseen precipice; that thought alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had stopt his fall, secured him all our own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from his hypochondriac dreams he had slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still his unsold Esau’s birthright kept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis thus we see him lost, thus mourn his fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That single teint alone has sullied all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></span>
<span class="i2">So have I in the Muses garden seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spreading rose, or blooming jessamine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once from whose bosom the whole Hybla train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The industrious treasurers of the rich plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those winged foragers for their fragrant prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On loaded thighs bore thousand sweets away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shaded by a sullen venomed guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cankered and sooted o’er to a spider’s nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sweets thus soured, what melancholy change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What an ill-natur’d lour, a face so strange!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life one whole long scene of all unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And airy hopes his thin cameleon-feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased only with the pride of being preferred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The echoed voice to his own listning herd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A magisterial Belweather tape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lordly leader of his bleating troop.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These doctrines our young Sullenists preach round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The texts which their poetic silence found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why the doctor of their chair, why thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their great rabbinic voice, thus silent too?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could Noll’s once meteor glories blaze so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make thee that all-prostrate zealot there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange, that that fiery nose could boast that charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy muse with those seraphic raptures warm!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our fair Albion star to shine so bleak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her radiant influence so chill, so weak!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gorged with his riotous festival of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could thy weak stomach pule at Mary’s name!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was thy junior palate more canine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now in years grows squeamish, and more fine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fie, peevish-niggard, with thy flowing store<br /></span>

<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>

<p class="table right">
<span class="trow"><i>1720-1, March.</i></span></p>

<p>It is now almost fourteen years since these lines
were first written; and as I had no thought of
making them public, I laid them aside among other
papers; where they had still continued private, if
it had not, in a manner, become my duty to print
them, by the noble regard which is paid to Mr
Dryden’s memory, by his grace the Duke of Buckingham,
who, to his high quality, has added the
liberal distinction of having long been at once both
an eminent patron of elegant literature, and the
most accomplished judge and pattern of it.</p>

<p>It might indeed seem an adventurous presumption
to offer so trivial a poem to his Grace’s view;
but he who is able to instruct the most skilful writer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
will have benevolence enough to forgive the
imperfections of the weakest, and to consider the
inscribing these slight verses to his Grace, merely
as a respectful acknowledgment of the common obligation
he has laid upon all who have a true value
for English poetry, by thus honouring the remains
of a man who advanced it so highly, and is so justly
celebrated for beauty of imagination, and force and
delicacy of expression and numbers.</p>

<p>I must also observe, that I have had the happiness
to see one part of these verses abundantly disproved
by Mr Pope, and accordingly I retract it
with pleasure; for that admirable author, who evidently
inherits the bright invention, and the harmonious
versification of Mr Dryden, has increased
the reputation his other ingenious writings had obtained
him, by the permanent fame of having finished
a translation of the Iliad of Homer, with surprising
genius and merit.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Our great forefathers, in poetic song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were rude in diction, though their sense was strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-measured verse they knew not how to frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their words ungraceful, and the cadence lame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too far they wildly ranged to start the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did too much of Fairy-land display;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their rugged dissonance of lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True manly thought debased with trifles shines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each gaudy flower that wantons on the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must not appear within the curious bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nature’s chosen birth should flourish there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with their beauties crown the sweet parterre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></span>
<span class="i2">Such was the scene, when Dryden came to found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More perfect lays, with harmony of sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What lively colours glow on every draught!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How bright his images, how raised his thought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parts proportioned to their proper place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strength supported, and adorned with grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With what perfection did his artful hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The various kinds of poesy command!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole choir of Muses at his call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his rich song, which was inspired of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke from the chords of his enchanting lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his breast the fulness of their fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As while the sun displays his lordly light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host of stars are humbly veiled from sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till when he falls, they kindle all on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smartly sparkle in the nightly sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fellow bards suspended thus their ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drowned in the strong effulgence of his day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But glowing to their rise, at his decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each cast his beams, and each began to shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As years advance, the abated soul, in most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks to low ebb, in second childhood lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoiling age, dishonouring our kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robs all the treasures of the wasted mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hovering clouds obscures the muffled sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dim suffusion of enduring night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the rich fervour of his rising rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevailed o’er all the infirmities of age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, unimpaired by injuries of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoyed the bloom of a perpetual prime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fire not less, he more correctly writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ripened judgment, and digested wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the luxuriant ardour of his youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeding years had tamed to better growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to break the body’s crust away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give the expanded mind more room to play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, in its evening, opened on the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Surprising beams of full meridian light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thrifty of its splendour it had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its lustre had reserved till then.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So the descending sun, which hid his ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mists before, diminishing the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks radiant out upon the dazzled eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a blaze of glory leaves the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Revolving time had injured Chaucer’s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimmed the brilliant lustre of his fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deformed his language, and his wit depressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His serious sense oft sinking to a jest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost a stranger even to British eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We scarcely knew him in the rude disguise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, clothed by thee, the burnished bard appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all his glory, and new honours wears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Ennius was by Virgil changed of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found him rubbish, and he left him gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who but thyself could Homer’s weight sustain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And match the voice of his majestic strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Phœbus’ wrath the sovereign poet sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the big passion of contending kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tender pinions of a gentle muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who little points in epigram pursues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with a short excursion, meekly plays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fluttering wings in mean enervate lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could make a flight like this; to reach the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle’s vigour can alone suffice.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In every part the courtly Ovid’s style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy various versions beautifully foil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here smoothly turned melodious measures move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feed the flame, and multiply the love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet they flow, so touch the heaving heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They teach the doctor<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> in his boasted art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the theme demands a manly tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime he speaks in accents not his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></span>
<span class="i0">The bristly boar, and the tremendous rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the fell Centaurs in the fight engage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruel storm where Ceyx lost his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep sorrows of his widowed wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The covered cavern, and the still abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of empty visions, and the Sleepy God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powers of nature, in her wonderous reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old forms subverting, to produce again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mould the mass anew, the important verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does with such dignity of words rehearse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Virgil, proud of unexampled fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks with concern, and fears a rival name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What vaunting Grecians, of their knowledge vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lying legends insolently feign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of magic verses, whose persuasive charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeased the soul with glowing passion warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then discomposed the calm, and changed the scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the height of madness vexed again,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast accomplished in thy wondrous song,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With utmost energy of numbers strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flow of rage comes hurrying on amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the refluent tide ebbs out again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quiet pause succeeds; when unconfined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rushes back, and swells upon the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inimitable lay, through all the maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of harmony’s sweet labyrinth, displays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of music, and Cecilia’s praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At first it lifts the flattered monarch high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With boasted lineage, to his kindred sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the pleasures of the flowing bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mellow mirth, unbends his easy soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbles now, and saddens all the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sense of human miseries expressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></span>
<span class="i0">Relenting pity in each face appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavy sorrow ripens into tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief is forbid; and see! in every eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gaiety of love, and wanton joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft smiles and airs, which tenderly inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful hope, and languishing desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo! the pealing verse provokes around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frown of rage, and kindles with the sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the low’ring storm at once arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ardent vengeance sparkling in their eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fury boils high, and zeal of fell debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demanding ruin, and denouncing fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ye British beauties, in whose finished face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smile the gay honours of each bloomy grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose forms, inimitably fair, invite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sighing heart, and cheer the ravished sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, what sweet transports, and complacent joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise in your bosoms, and your soul employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When royal Emily, the tuneful bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paints in his song, and makes the rich reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of knightly arms, in costly lists arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world at once contending for the maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How nobly great does Sigismonda shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With constant faith, and courage masculine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No menaces could bend her mind to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for her love she dies without a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Iphigenia, with her radiant eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the bright sun, illuminates the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In clouded Cymon chearful day began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaked the sleeping soul, and charmed him into man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasing legends, to your honour, prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of beauty, and the force of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, after him, can equally rehearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such various subjects, in such various verse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the raptures of his strain controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At will, each passion, and command the soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not ancient Orpheus, whose surprising lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did beasts, and rocks, and rooted woods, inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweetly sung, nor with superior art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothed the sad shades, and softened Pluto’s heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All owned, at distance, his distinguished name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor vainly vied to share his awful fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unrivalled, living, he enlarged his praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, dying, left without an heir his bays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Philip’s son his universal reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extended amply over earth and main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through conquered climes with ready triumph rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruled the nations with his powerful nod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when fate called the mighty chief away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None could succeed to his imperial sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wide empire languished to decay.<br /></span>

<p>The many and great obligations which you have
been pleased to lay on me, give me the greatest confusion
imaginable at present, when I consider that
I am suing for a greater favour than all, in having
the liberty to prefix your name to these lines; which
though I am sensible they will be condemned by
the great, yet the shame of that can no way affect
you, when I do you the justice to assure the town,
that it is contrary to your knowledge that you are

<p>Nay, you were not guilty of so much as of the
knowledge of this my <i>wicked intentions</i>; wicked. I
mean, if it should offend you and my other friends,
who need not blush for me, since I have already
such a terror upon my conscience for this aggression,
as is, I think, a punishment in some measure
equal to any crime; and all that I can urge in my
defence is, that it was pure respect to the dear memory
of this great man, to whom I had the honour
to be known, that provoked, or, let me rather say,
obliged me to expose myself on this occasion. I
never attempted any thing in this measure for the
public before; and I doubt not that I shall do yet
severer penance for it, in the censures of our <i>awful

<span class="i0">To form his image, and to make it true,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rude matter indisposed he formed polite,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His periods shine harmonious in the close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a muse presided in his prose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet unaffected plain, but strong his style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It overflows to fructify, like Nile.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His lines (those sacred reliques of the mind)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by the laws of fate or war confined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of flames will everlasting prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devouring rust of time, or angry Jove.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">L&mdash;gh aim’d to rise above great Dr&mdash;-n’s height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lofty Dryden kept a steady flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like D&aelig;dalus, he times with prudent care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His well-waxed wings, and waves in middle air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with the sacred snow of reverend years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dryden above the ignobler crowd appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raises his laurelled head, and, as he goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er-shoulders all, and like Apollo shows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The native spark, which first advanced his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By industry he kindled to a flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to a different coast his judgment flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left the old world behind, and found a new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the strong columns of his lasting wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instructive Dryden built, and peopled it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></span>
<span class="i0">In every page delight and profit shines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal sense flows in his mighty lines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His images so strong and lively be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear not words alone, but substance see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proper phrase of our exalted tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such perfection from his numbers sprung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tropes continued, and his figures fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of a piece throughout, and all divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adapted words and sweet expressions move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our various passions, pity, rage, and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I weep to hear fond Antony complain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Shakespeare’s fancy, but in Virgil’s strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though for the comic, others we prefer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself the judge; nor does his judgment err.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But comedy, ’tis thought, can never claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding title of a poem’s name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For raillery, and what creates a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrays no lofty genius, nor a style.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heavenly heat refuses to be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a town character, and comic mien.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we would do him right, we must produce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sophoclean buskin; when his muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her loud accents filled the listning ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peals applauding shook the theatre.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They fondly seek, great name, to blast thy praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who think that foreign banks produced thy bays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is he obliged to France, who draws from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By English energy, their captive sense?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Edward and famed Henry warred in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subduing what they could not long retain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now, beyond our arms, the muse prevails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poets conquer, when the hero fails.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This does superior excellence betray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O could I write in thy immortal way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Art be Nature’s scholar, and can make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such great improvements, Nature must forsake<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Her ancient style; and in some grand design,      }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must her own originals decline,               }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the noblest copies follow thine.          }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This all the world must offer to thy praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this Thalia sang in rural lays.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As sleep to weary drovers on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a sweet river to a thirsty swain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such divine Dryden’s charming verses show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please like the river, like the river flow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his first years in mighty order ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cradled infancy bespoke the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his lips the waxen artists hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathed ambrosial odours as they sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yellow clusters from their hives they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his tongue distilled eternal dew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence from his mouth harmonious numbers broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweet than honey from the knotted oak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More smooth than streams, that from a mountain glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lofty as the top from whence they slide.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Long he possest the hereditary plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved by all the herdsmen, and the swains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he resigned his flock, opprest with years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And olden’d in his woe, as well as fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still, like Etna’s mount, he kept his fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look’d, like beauteous roses on a brier:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smiled, like Phœbus in a stormy morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sung, like Philomel against a thorn.<br /></span>

<span class="medium"><i>Or, Poems written by nine several Ladies, upon the death of
the late famous</i> <span class="smcap">John Dryden</span>, <i>Esq.</i></span></h2>


<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As earth thy body keeps, thy soul the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall this verse preserve thy memory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou shalt make it live, because it sings of thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>London: printed for Richard Basset, at the Mitre, in Fleet
Street, 1700.</i></p>

<p>The work is dedicated to the Right Hon. Charles
Montague, (Lord Halifax,) by the publisher Basset,
who thus apologizes for the intrusion:</p>

<p>“The ladies indeed themselves might have had
a better plea for your reception; but since the modesty
which is natural to the sex they are of, will not
suffer them to do that violence to their tempers, I
think myself obliged to make a present of what is
written in honour of the most consummate poet
among our English dead, to the most distinguished
among the living. You have been pleased already
to shew your respect to his memory, in contributing
so largely to his burial, notwithstanding he had that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
unhappiness of conduct, when alive, to give you
cause to disclaim the protection of him.”</p>

<p>The dedication is followed by a commendatory
copy of verses, addressed to the publisher, and signed
Philomusus; of which most readers will think
the following lines a sufficient specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hence issues forth a most delightful song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair as their sex, and as their judgment strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving its force, and tempting in its ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secured of fame, unknowing to displease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its every word like Aganippe, clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close its meaning, and its sense severe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As virtuous thoughts with chaste expression join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make them truly, what they feign, divine.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poems of these divine ladies, as their eulogist
phrases them, appear in the following order:</p>

<p><i>Melpomene</i>, the Tragic Muse, personated by Mrs
Manley, refers to his elegies and tragedies. Melpomene
sorrows for him:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who sorrowed Killigrew’s untimely fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than Roman made her funeral;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspired by me, for me he could command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright Abingdon’s rich monument shall stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For evermore the wonder of the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oldham he snatched from an ignoble fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed his cross star for one more fortunate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who would not with pride resign his breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be so loved, to be so blest in death?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The eulogiums on Cromwell and Charles then
praised. Of the last it is said,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For this alone he did deserve the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Ranelagh, for her victorious eyes.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Cleopatra and St Catharine are mentioned; then</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Dorax and Sebastian both contend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shew the generous enemy and friend.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p><i>Urania</i>, the Divine Muse, by the Honourable the
Lady Peirce. This lady, after much tragic dole, is
wonderfully comforted by recollecting that Garth
survives, though Dryden is dead:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">More I’ll not urge, but know, our wishes can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No higher soar, since Garth’s the glorious man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him let us constitute in Dryden’s stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let laurels ever flourish on his head.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Urania, after mentioning Virgil, exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O give us Homer yet, thou glorious bard!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Erato</i>, the Amorous Muse, by Mrs S. Field. She
claims the merit of Dryden’s love poems, on the
following grounds:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oft I for ink did radiant nectar bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave him quills from infant Cupid’s wing.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Euterpe</i>, the Lyric Muse, by Mrs J. E. Euterpe,
of course, pours forth her sorrow in a scrambling
Pindaric ode:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, oh! they could not stand the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an ill-natured and lethargic age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, spite of wit, would stupidly be wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All noble raptures, extasies despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only plodders after sense will prize.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Euterpe eulogizeth</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Garth, whom the god of wisdom did foredoom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stock with eloquence, to pay thy tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most triumphant rites of ancient Rome.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Euterpe is true to her own character; for one may
plod in vain after sense through her lyric effusion.</p>

<p><i>Thalia</i>, the Comic Muse, by Mrs Manley. A pastoral
dialogue betwixt Alexis, Daphne, Aminta, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Thalia. After the usual questions concerning the
cause of sorrow, Thalia, invoked by the nymphs
and swains, sings a ditty, bearing the following
burden:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bring here the spring, and throw fresh garlands on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the flowers that wait the rising sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These ever-greens, true emblems of his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take, Daphne, these, and scatter through the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the eternal Dryden’s worth I tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lovely bard, that so lamented fell.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Clio</i>, or the Historic Muse, by Mrs Pix, the authoress
of a tragedy called “Queen Catharine, or
the Ruins of Love.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stop here, my muse, no more thy office boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This drop of praise is in an ocean lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His works alone are trumpets of his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every line will chronicle his name.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Calliope</i>, the Heroic Muse, by Mrs C. Trotter.
This is the best of these pieces. Calliope complains,
that she is more unhappy than her sisters of the
sock and buskin, still worshipped successfully by
Vanburgh and Granville, in the epic province:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Blackmore, in spite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me and nature, still presumes to write;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy and dozed, crawls out the tedious length;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfit to soar, drags on with peasant strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight he cannot raise.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poem concludes,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Now you who aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fading power, at bright immortal fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious monarchs, all whom glory warms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cease your vain toil, throw down your conquering arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your active souls confine, since you must die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like vulgar men, your names and actions lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where Trojan heroes, had not Homer lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lain forgot, nor ruined Troy survived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more their glories I can e’er retrieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nature can no second Dryden give.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Terpsichore</i>, a Lyric Muse, by Mrs L. D. <i>ex tempore</i>.
Albeit a lyric muse, Terpsichore laments in
hexameters:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just as the gods were listening to my strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thousand loves danced o’er the etherial plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my own radiant hair my harp I strung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in glad concert all my sisters sung:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An universal harmony above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspired us all with gaiety and love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horrid sound dashed our immortal mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafted by sighs from the unlucky earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et c&aelig;tera, et c&aelig;tera.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Polyhymnia</i>, the Muse of Rhetoric, by Mrs D. E.
This lady concludes the volume thus:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Incessant groans be all my rhetoric now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My immortality I would forego,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than drag this chain of endless woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mighty Father, hear a daughter’s prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cure me by death from deathless sad despair!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<span class="i0">How long, great poet, shall thy sacred lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provoke our wonder, and transcend our praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></span>
<span class="i0">Can neither injuries of time, or age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Damp thy poetic heat, and quench thy rage?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so thy Ovid in his exile wrote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief chilled his breast, and checked his rising thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive and sad, his drooping muse betrays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman genius in its last decays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevailing warmth has still thy mind possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And second youth is kindled in thy breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mak’st the beauties of the Romans known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And England boasts of riches not her own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lines have heightened Virgil’s majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Horace wonders at himself in thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou teachest Persius to inform our isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In smoother numbers, and a clearer style:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Juvenal, instructed in thy page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edges his satire, and improves his rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy copy casts a fairer light on all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still outshines the bright original.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now Ovid boasts the advantage of thy song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells his story in the British tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy charming verse, and fair translations show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How thy own laurel first began to grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wild Lycaon, changed by angry Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frighted at himself, ran howling through the woods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O may’st thou still the noble tale prolong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor age, nor sickness interrupt thy song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then may we wond’ring read, how human limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have watered kingdoms, and dissolved in streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those rich fruits that on the fertile mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned yellow by degrees, and ripened into gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How some in feathers, or a ragged hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have lived a second life, and different natures tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then will thy Ovid, thus transformed, reveal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nobler change than he himself can tell.<br /></span>

Mr Walsh was born in 1663, and in 1691 must have been
twenty-eight years old. Still he was but a youth in the eyes of
Dryden, who was now advanced in life.</p></div>

Mr Malone observes, that, according to Antony Wood, (<i>Ath.
Oxon.</i> ii. 423.) this was not said <i>of</i> Waller, but <i>by</i> that poet, of
Sir John Denham.&mdash;“In the latter end of the year 1641, Sir John
published the tragedy called the ‘Sophy,’ which took extremely
much, and was admired by all ingenious men, particularly by
Edmund Waller of Beaconsfield, who then said of the author, that
he broke out, like the Irish rebellion, threescore thousand strong,
before any body was aware, or the least suspected it.” Mr Malone
adds, that the observation is more applicable to Denham
than to Waller; for Denham, from the age of sixteen, when he
went to Trinity College, in Oxford, November 18, 1631, to the
time of his father’s death, January 6, 1638-9, was considered as
a dull and dissipated young man; whereas Waller distinguished himself,
as a poet, before he was eighteen. Besides, the “Sophy”
was published just when the Irish rebellion broke out.</p></div>

A tragedy by Racine. St Evremont, in a dissertation on this
play, addressed to Madame Borneau, severely reprobates the fault
so common in French tragedy, of making a play, though the scene
is laid in ancient Rome or India, centre and turn upon Parisian
manners. He concludes, that Corneille is the only author of the

From these expressions, one would suppose Sir Henry Shere
to have been a seaman, which may also be conjectured from his
writing an “Essay on the certainty and causes of the Earth’s Motion
on its Axis;” and a “Discourse concerning the Mediterranean
Sea and the Straits of Gibraltar;” the one published in 1698,
the other in 1705. The naval and military professions were, however,
formerly accounted less absolutely distinct branches of service
than at present. Many officers distinguished themselves in
both. Mr Malone may therefore be right in conjecturing Sir
Henry Shere to have been a soldier, though his studies would argue
him a seaman or engineer.</p></div>

“The fame of Nicholas the Fifth, (who sat in the papal chair
from 1447 to 1455,) has not,” says Mr Gibbon,&mdash;<i>Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, vi. 429, 4to.) “been adequate to his
merits. From a plebeian origin, he raised himself, by his virtue
and learning. The character of the man prevailed over the interests
of the pope; and he sharpened those weapons, which were
soon pointed against the Roman church. He had been the friend
of the most eminent scholars of the age; he became their patron;
and such was the humility of his manners, that the change was
scarcely discernible, either to them or to himself. If he pressed
the acceptance of a liberal gift, it was not as the measure of desert,
but as the proof of benevolence; and when modest merit
declined his bounty, ‘Accept it,’ would he say, with a consciousness
of his own worth; ‘you will not always have a Nicholas
among ye.’ The influence of the holy see pervaded Christendom;
and he exerted that influence in the search, not of benefices,
but of books. From the ruins of the Byzantine libraries, from the
darkest monasteries of Germany and Britain, he collected the
dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity; and wherever the
original could not be removed, a faithful copy was transcribed,
and transmitted for his use. The Vatican, the old repository for
bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery, was daily replenished
with more precious furniture; and such was the industry
of Nicholas, that, in a reign of eight years, he formed a library
of five thousand volumes. To his munificence, the Latin world
was indebted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus, Polybius,
Thucydides, Herodotus, and Appian; of Strabo’s Geography; of
the Iliad; of the most valuable works of Plato and Aristotle; of
Ptolemy and Theophrastus; and of the fathers of the Greek
church. The example of the Roman pontiff was preceded, or
imitated, by a Florentine merchant, who governed the republic
without arms, and without a title. Cosmo, of Medicis, was the
father of a line of princes, whose name and age are almost synonymous
with the restoration of learning. His credit was ennobled
into fame; his riches were dedicated to the service of mankind;
he corresponded at once with Cairo and London, and a cargo of
Indian spices and Greek books was imported in the same vessel.
The genius and education of his grandson, Lorenzo, rendered him
not only a patron, but a judge and candidate in the literary race.
In his palace, distress was entitled to relief, and merit to reward.
His leisure hours were delightfully spent in the Platonic academy;
he encouraged the emulation of Demetrius Chalcocondyles and
Angelo Politian; and his active missionary, Janus Lascaris, returned
from the East with a treasure of two hundred manuscripts,
fourscore of which were as yet unknown in the libraries of Europe.
The rest of Italy was animated by a similar spirit, and the progress
of the nation repaid the liberality of the princes. The Latins
held the exclusive property of their own literature; and these
disciples of Greece were soon capable of transmitting and improving
the lessons which they had imbibed. After a short succession
of foreign teachers, the tide of emigration subsided; but the
language of Constantinople was spread beyond the Alps; and the
natives of France, Germany, and England, imparted to their country
the sacred fire which they had kindled in the schools of Florence
and Rome.”</p></div>

Polybius, the historian, was born at Megalopolis, in Arcadia,
in the fourth year of the 143d Olympiad, about 205 years before
the Christian &aelig;ra. Being carried to Rome as an hostage, he became
the companion and friend of the younger Scipio Africanus;
accompanied him in his campaigns; and is said to have witnessed
the destruction of Carthage, in the 158th Olympiad. Having returned
to his native country, he died in the 164th Olympiad, 124
years before Christ, in consequence of a fall from his horse.

The history of Polybius embraced the space from the first year

years.</p></div>

Philip de Commines, author of the excellent Memoirs of his
own time. He was born in Flanders, and was for several years
a distinguished ornament of the court of Charles the Bold, Duke
of Burgundy, his native sovereign; but was tempted to divert
his service for that of Louis XI. by whom he was employed in
several negociations. After the death of that monarch, Commines
fell into disgrace with his successor, and was long detained in prison:
he died in 1509. It was of this historian Catherine de Medicis
was wont to say, “that he made as many heretics in the state, as
Luther in the Church.”</p></div>

A. D. 375. Rufinus was chief prefect of the East. The
person here alluded to was only count of fifteen provinces. Dryden,
writing from memory, confounded the offices of the murderer
and murdered. See the next note.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a>
Gibbon thus narrates the catastrophe:&mdash;“The extreme parsimony
of Rufinus left him only the reproach and envy of ill-gotten
wealth. His dependents served him without attachment; the universal
hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of
servile fear. The fate of Lucian proclaimed to the East, that the
prefect, whose industry was much abated in the dispatch of ordinary
business, was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge.
Lucian, (the son of the prefect Florentius, the oppressor
of Gaul, and the enemy of Julian,) had employed a considerable
part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase
the friendship of Rufinus, and the high office of Count of
the East. But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the
maxims of the court and of the times; disgraced his benefactor,
by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration; and
presumed to refuse an act of injustice, which might have tended
to the profit of the emperor’s uncle. Arcadius was easily persuaded
to resent the supposed insult; and the prefect of the East
resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated
against this ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed,
with incessant speed, the journey of seven or eight hundred
miles, from Constantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of
Syria at the dead of night, and spread universal consternation
among a people ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his
character. The count of the fifteen provinces of the East was
dragged, like the vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal
of Rufinus. Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity,
which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, Lucian
was condemned, almost without a trial, to suffer a cruel and ignominious
punishment. The ministers of the tyrant, by the order,
and in the presence, of their master, beat him on the neck with
leather thongs, armed at the extremities with lead; and when he
fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in a close
litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant
city. No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act, the
sole object of his expedition, than he returned amidst the deep
and silent curses of a trembling people, from Antioch to Constantinople;
and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing,
without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with the
emperor of the East.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gibbon’s</span> <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman

Charles Blount, the son of Sir Henry, and brother to Sir
Edward Pope Blount. He early appeared as a defender and
admirer of Dryden, by publishing an answer to Leigh’s “Censure
of the Rota in the Conquest of Granada.” It was entitled,
“Mr Dryden vindicated, in Reply to the Friendly Vindication of
Mr Dryden, with Reflections on the Rota.” Mr Blount distinguished
himself as a friend to civil liberty during the crisis preceding
the Revolution; but was still better known by the deistical
tracts entitled “<i>Anima Mundi</i>,” “Life of Appolonius Tyaneus,”
“Diana of the Ephesians,” and the “<i>Religio Laici</i>,” which
last he published anonymously in 1683, and inscribed to our
author.
</p>
<p>
The death of Blount was voluntary. Having lost his wife, the
daughter of Sir Timothy Tyrrel of Shotover, he fell in love with
her sister, and being unable to remove her scruples upon the
lawfulness of their union, shot himself in a fit of despair, in August
1693. His miscellaneous works were published by Galden in
1695.
</p>
<p>
He was a man of deep and extensive reading, and probably
better qualified, in point of learning, to translate Lucian, than
most of his coadjutors.</p></div>

The lady to whom this letter is addressed was our author’s

She probably was born, (says Mr Malone,) about the year 1637,
and died, unmarried, some time after 1707.

one from the fair lady, with a present of writing materials. It is a
woeful sample of the gallantry of the time, alternately coarse and
pedantic.</p></div>

In the year 1672, Monsieur Schomberg was invited into England
to command the army raised for the Dutch war, then encamped
on Blackheath. He was to be joined in this command
with Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who held a commission of
lieutenant-general only. But when Schomberg arrived, he refused
to serve equally with Buckingham, and was made general;
on which the other resigned his commission in disgust. (See Sheffield,
Duke of Buckingham’s <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 5.) Dryden, still smarting
under the “Rehearsal,” just then come out, was probably not
sorry to take this opportunity to turn the author’s pretensions into
ridicule.</p></div>

Henry Brouncker, younger brother of William, Viscount
Brouncker. He was a gentleman of the Duke of York’s bed-chamber,
and carried the false order to slacken sail, after the
great battle in 1665, when the Duke was asleep, by which the
advantage gained in the victory was entirely lost. There is a great
cloud over the story; but that Brouncker was an infamous character,
must be concluded on all hands. He was expelled the
House of Commons; and countenanced by the king more than
he deserved, being “never notorious for any thing but the highest
degree of impudence, and stooping to the most infamous offices.”

Aubery de Vere, the twentieth and last Earl of Oxford, of

some authorities, to be Mrs Marshall, but conjectured, by Mr

for his protection. The epithet, applied to him in the lines,

in this case, the date of their being delivered has been placed too
late. Exact accuracy is of little consequence; but I fear the hint
in the letter gives some reason for Tom Brown’s alleging, that Dryden
flattered alternately the wits of the town at the cost of the
university, and the university scholars at the expence of the London
audience. I cry that facetious person mercy, for having said
there was no proof of his accusation. See Vol. X. p. 113.</p></div>

In the hall of the college of Westminster, when the boys are
at dinner, it is, <i>ex officio</i>, the place of the second boy, in the
second election, to keep order among the two under elections; and
if any word, after he has ordered silence, be spoken, except in
Latin, he says to the speaker, <i>tu es</i> <span class="smcap">CUSTOS</span>; and this term
passes from the second speaker to the third, or more, till dinner
is over. Whoever is then <i>custos</i>, has an imposition.</p>

To this curious and valuable letter, Mr Malone has added the
address to Rochester and the date, both of which are conjectural.
Hyde, Earl of Rochester, was made first commissioner of the treasury
in 1679, and continued prime minister till September 1684.
Let it be remembered by those men of talents, who may be tempted
to engage in the sea of politics, that Dryden thus sued for what
was his unquestionable due, within two years after having written
“Absalom and Achitophel,” and “The Medal,” in defence of the
government, to whom he was suppliant for so small a boon.</p></div>

the Chop-house, with Will Pate, <i>the learned woollen-draper</i>; then
we sauntered at china shops and booksellers; went to the tavern,
and drank two pints of white wine,” &amp;c. Mr William Pate was
educated at Trinity Hall in Cambridge, where he took the degree
of B.C.L. He died in 1746, and was buried at Lee, in Kent.</p>

This seems to imply a suspicion, though an odd one, that
Jacob, being bent to convert Dryden to his own views of politics,
intercepted his sons’ letters from Rome, as proceeding from an
interest hostile to his views. (See p. 140.) His earnest wish was,
that the &AElig;neid should be inscribed to King William.</p></div>

Tom Brown had, in the year of the Revolution, published

second Part, called the “Late Converts Exposed.” What this small
wit now had in hand is difficult to guess; none of his direct attacks
against Dryden appear in his works: but his insignificant
enmity survived Dryden, for he wrote a burlesque account of
the poet’s funeral in verse, and libelled his memory in prose, in
his “Letters from the Dead to the Living.”</p></div>

Of Mrs Steward Mr Malone gives the following account:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Thislady, who was not less distinguished for her talents and accomplishments
than her beauty and virtues, having been both a
painter and a poetess, was the eldest surviving daughter of John
Creed of Oundle, Esq (secretary to Charles II. for the affairs of
Tangier,) by Elizabeth Pickering, his wife, who was the only
daughter of Sir Gilbert Pickering, Baronet, our author’s cousin-german.
Her eldest son, Richard Creed, as we have seen, fell
in the battle of Blenheim, and was honoured with a monument in
Westminster Abbey. Her eldest daughter Elizabeth, was born in
the year 1672, and, in 1692, married Elmes Steward of Cotterstock,
in the county of Northampton, Esq.; where they principally
resided. By this gentleman, who is said to have preferred
field-sports to any productions of the Muses, she had three children;
Elizabeth, who became the wife of Thomas Gwillim, Esq.
of Old Court, in the parish of Whitchurch, near Ross in Herefordshire;
Anne, who died unmarried; and Jemima, who married
Elmes Spinckes of Aldwinckle, Esq. Mrs Steward, who survived
her husband above thirty years, in the latter part of her life became
blind, in which melancholy state she died at the house of
her son-in-law Mr Gwillim, at the age of seventy-one, Jan. 17,
1742-3; and a monument was erected to her memory in the
church of Whitchurch. The hall of Cotterstock-house was painted
in fresco by her, in a very masterly style, and she drew several
portraits of her friends in Northamptonshire. Her own portrait,
painted by herself, is in the possession of her kinswoman, Mrs Orel
of Queen Anne Street.”</p></div>

recusants to remove to their respective places of abode; or if they
had none, to the dwellings of their fathers or mothers; and not to
remove five miles from thence: and it charged the lord mayor
of London, and all other justices of peace, to put the statute 1st
William and Mary, c.9. for amoving Papists ten miles from London
and Westminster, into execution, by tendering them the declaration
therein mentioned; and also another act of William and

made the 4th of June, 1697, by the Earl of Sunderland, then
lord chamberlain of his majesty’s houshold, to prevent the profaneness
and immorality of the stage, several plays have lately
been acted, containing expressions contrary to religion and good
manners: And whereas the master of the revels has represented,
that, in contempt of the said order, the actors do often neglect to
leave out such profane and indecent expressions as he has thought
proper to be omitted: These are therefore to signify his majesties
pleasure, that you do not hereafter presume to act any thing in
any play, contrary to religion and good manners, as you shall answer
it at your utmost peril. Given under my hand this 18th of
February, 1698, in the eleventh year of his majesties reign.</p>

The founder of the Pepysian library, Magdalen College, Cambridge.
He was secretary to the Admiralty in the reign of Charles
II. and James II. “He first (says Granger, <i>Biogr. Hist.</i> iv. 322.)
reduced the affairs of the Admiralty to order and method; and
that method was so just, as to have been a standing model to his
successors in that important office. His ‘Memoirs’ relating to
the Navy is a well written piece; and his copious collection of
manuscripts, now remaining with the rest of his library at Magdalen
College in Cambridge, is an invaluable treasure of naval
knowledge. He was far from being a mere man of business: his
conversation and address had been greatly refined by travel. He
thoroughly understood and practised music; was a judge of painting,
sculpture, and architecture; and had more than a superficial
knowledge in history and philosophy. His fame among the Virtuosi
was such, that he was thought to be a very proper person to
be placed at the head of the Royal Society, of which he was some
time [1685, 1686,] president. His Prints have been already mentioned.
His collection of English Ballads, in five large folio volumes,
begun by Mr Selden, and carried down to 1700, is one of
his singular curiosities.&mdash;<i>Ob</i>. 26 May, 1703.”</p></div>

The lines alluded to occur in the Epistle to Driden of Chesterton,
(Vol. XI. p. 81.) They are very cautiously worded; yet
obviously imply, that opposition to government was one quality of
a good patriot. Dryden, sensible of the suspicion arising from his
politics and religion, seems, in this letter, to deprecate Montague’s
displeasure, and to prepossess him in favour of the poem, as inoffensive
toward the government. I am afraid, that indemnity was
all he had to hope for from the protection of this famed M&aelig;cenas;
at least, he returns no thanks for benefits hitherto received; and
of these he was no niggard where there was room for them. Pope’s
bitter verses on Halifax are well known:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dryden alone what wonder came not nigh,<br /></span>

interest of Halifax, They were never realised; whether from inattention,
or on account of his politics and religion, cannot now
be known.</p></div>

Charles Hopkins, son of Hopkins, Bishop of Derry, in Ireland.
He was educated at Cambridge, and became Bachelor of
Arts in 1688; he afterwards bore arms for King William in the
Irish wars. In 1694, he published a collection of epistolary poems
and translations; and in 1695, “The History of Love,” which last
gained him some reputation. Dorset honoured Hopkins with his
notice; and Dryden himself is said to have distinguished him from
the undergrowth of authors. He was careless both of his health
and reputation, and fell a martyr to excess in 1700, aged only
thirty-six years. Hopkins wrote three plays, 1. “Pyrrhus, King
of Epirus,” 1695; 2. “Boadicea, Queen of Britain,” 1697; 3.
“Friendship Improved.” This last is mentioned in the text as to
be acted on 7th November.</p></div>

 Mrs Thomas, “Curll’s Corinna,” well known as a hack
authoress some years after this period, was now commencing
her career. She was daughter of Emanuel Thomas, of the
Inner Temple, barrister. Her person, as well as her writings,
seems to have been dedicated to the service of the public. The
story of her having obtained a parcel of Pope’s letters, written
in youth, from Henry Cromwell, to whom they were addressed,
and selling them to Curll the bookseller, is well known.
In that celebrated collection, 2d Vol. 8vo. 1735, the following
letters from Dryden also appear. It would seem Corinna
had contrived to hook an acquaintance upon the good-natured
poet, by the old pretext of sending him two poems for
his opinion. She afterwards kept up some communication with
his family, which she made the ground of two marvellous stories,
one concerning the astrological predictions of the poet, the other
respecting the mode of his funeral.</p></div>

In this lively romance, written to ridicule the doctrines of Rosicrucian
philosophy, we are informed, that the Nymphs of water,
air, earth, and fire, are anxious to connect themselves with the sages
of the human race. I remember nothing about their wish to be
baptized; but that desire was extremely strong among the fays, or
female genii, of the North, who were anxious to demand it for the
children they had by human fathers, as the means of securing to
them that immortality which they themselves wanted. Einar Godmund,
an ancient priest, informed the learned Torf&aelig;us, that they
often solicited this favour, (usually in vain,) and were exceedingly
incensed at the refusal. He gave an instance of Siward Fostre, who
had promised to one of these fays, that if she bore him a child, he
would cause it to be christened. In due time she appeared, and
laid the child on the wall of the church-yard, with a chalice of
gold and a rich cope, as an offering at the ceremony. But Siward,
ashamed of his extraordinary intrigue, refused to acknowledge the
child, which, therefore, remained unbaptized. The incensed mother
re-appeared and carried off the infant and the chalice, leaving
behind the cope, fragments of which were still preserved. But
she failed not to inflict upon Siward and his descendants, to the
ninth generation, a peculiar disorder, with which they were long
afflicted. Other stories to the same purpose are told by Torf&aelig;us
in his preface to the “History of Hrolf Kraka,” 12mo. 1715. I
suppose, however, that Dryden only recollected the practice of
magicians, who, on invoking astral spirits, and binding them to their
service, usually imposed on them some distinguishing name. It is
possible Paracelsus says something to the purpose in his Magna
Philosophia.</p></div>

In printing this letter, Mr Malone says, he “followed a transcript
which he made some years ago from the original. It is preserved
in a small volume in the Bodleian Library, consisting
chiefly of Pope’s original Letters to Henry Cromwell, which Mrs
Thomas sold to Curll, the bookseller, who published them unfaithfully.
It afterwards fell into the hands of Dr Richard Rawlinson,
by whom it was bequeathed to that Library.”</p></div>

Lord Somers.&mdash;Mr Malone is of opinion, that this passage adds
some support to what has been suggested in our author’s Life,
that a part of Dryden’s “Satire to his Muse” was written in his
younger days by this great man. Yet I cannot think, that great
man would be concerned in so libellous a piece: and in the same
breath Dryden tells us, that he hoped Montague, who had really
written against him, was much his friend.</p></div>

Dennis’s “Iphigenia” was performed at the theatre in Little
Lincoln’s Fields; and “Achilles, or Iphigenia in Aulis,” written
by Abel Boyer, and, if we are to believe the author, corrected by
Dryden, was acted at the theatre in Drury-Lane. Dennis says in
his Preface, that the success of his play was “neither despicable,
nor extraordinary;” but Gildon, in his “Comparison between the
two Stages,” 8vo, 1702, informs us, that it was acted but six times;
and that the other tragedy, after four representations, was laid
aside. <span class="smcap">Malone</span>.</p></div>

In the London Gazette, No. 3557, Thursday, December 14,
1699, it is mentioned, that a proclamation for preventing and
<i>punishing</i> immorality and profaneness, had been issued out on the
11th instant. We know, by the experience of our own time, the justice
of Dryden’s observation.</p></div>

Not at St James’ Church, but at the Chapel Royal. The
pews, it seems, were raised to prevent the devotions of the maids

maliciously supposes, that the intention was to confine the sun-beams
of their eyes to the preacher, Bishop Burnet. The ballad
itself may be found Vol. X. p. 270.</p></div>

This poem is a banter upon the interest which the nobility
took in the disputes between the Dury-Lane theatre, where
Skipwith was manager, and that in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, of which
Betterton was sovereign. The “Island Princess” of Fletcher had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">been converted into a sort of opera, by Peter Motteux, and acted</span><br />
at Drury-Lane in 1699. The peculiar taste of Rich for every
thing that respected show and machinery is well known.</p>

King William had made large grants of land out of the forfeited
estates in Ireland, to his foreign servants, Portland, Albemarle,
Rochford, Galway, and Athlone, and to his favourite, Lady Orkney.
The Commons, who now watched every step of their
deliverer with bitter jealousy, appointed a commission to enquire
into the value of these grants; and followed it with a bill for resuming
and applying them to the payment of public debt; “and;
in order to prevent the bill from being defeated in the House of
Lords, they, by a form seldom used, and which very seldom
should be used, tacked it to their bill of supply; so that the Lords
could not refuse the one, without disappointing the other. The
Lords, to secure themselves from that insignificancy, to which the
form of the bill tended to reduce them, disputed, in some conferences
with the Commons, the form of it with warmth; but the resumption
which it contained with indifference. And in both Houses,
even the servants of the Crown gave themselves little trouble to
defeat it; partly to gain popularity, but more from national antipathy
to foreigners, and envy at gifts in which themselves were
no sharers. The King, making allowances for national weaknesses,
and for those of human nature, passed the bill without any
complaint in public, but with a generous indignation in private,
which perhaps made the blow fall more heavy on his friends, when,
in order to soften it, he said to them, that it was for his sake, and
not for their own, they were suffering,”&mdash;<i>Dalrymple’s Annals.</i>
William felt so deeply the unkindness offered to him, that he prorogued
the Parliament without the usual ceremony of a speech
from the throne.</p></div>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
